        DEFINITIONS
     ---------------------------
  1. See the Uniform System of Accounts for a definition of control.
  2. Direct control is that which is exercised without interposition of an intermediary.
  3. Indirect control is that which is exercised by the interposition of an intermediary that exercises direct control.
  4. Joint control is that in which neither interest can effectively control or direct action without the consent of the other, as where the
voting control is equally divided between two holders, or each party holds a veto power over the other. Joint control may exist by mutual
agreement or understanding between two or more parties who together have control within the meaning of the definition of control in the
Uniform System of Accounts, regardless of the relative voting rights of each party.

respondent or any securities or other assets owned by the respondent, including prices, expiration dates, and other material information
relating to exercise of the options, warrants, or rights. Specify the amount of such securities or assets any officer, director, associated

2015 Washington General Rate Cases
In January 2016, the Company received an order (Order 05) that concluded its electric and natural gas general rate cases that were
originally filed with the WUTC in February 2015. New electric and natural gas rates were effective on January 11, 2016.

                                                 Important Changes During the Quarter/Year
PC Petition for Judicial Review
In March 2016, PC filed in Thurston County Superior Court a Petition for Judicial Review of the WUTC's Order 05 described above.
In April 2016, this matter was certified for review directly by the Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court in the State of
Washington.
On August 7, 2018, the Court of Appeals issued a "Published Opinion" (Opinion) which concluded that the WUTC's use of an
attrition allowance to calculate Avista Corp.'s rate base violated Washington law. In the Opinion, the Court stated that because the
projected additions to rate base in the future were not "used and useful" for service at the time the request for the rate increase was
made, they may not lawfully be included in the Company's rate base to justify a rate increase. Accordingly, the Court concluded that
the WUTC erred in including an attrition allowance in the calculation of Avista Corp.’s electric and natural gas rate base. The Court
noted, however, that the law does not prohibit an attrition allowance in the calculation, for ratemaking purposes, of recoverable
operating and maintenance expense. Since the WUTC order provided one lump sum attrition allowance without distinguishing what
portion was for rate base and which was for operating and maintenance expenses or other considerations, the Court struck all portions
of the attrition allowance attributable to Avista Corp.'s rate base and reversed and remanded the case for the WUTC to recalculate
Avista Corp.’s rates without including an attrition allowance in the calculation of rate base.
On March 6, 2020, the Company received an order from the WUTC that will require it to refund $8.5 million to electric and natural
gas customers. The Company will refund $4.9 million to electric customers and $3.6 million to natural gas customers. The Company
recorded a customer refund liability of $8.5 million in 2019.
2017 General Rate Cases
On April 26, 2018, the WUTC issued a final order in our electric and natural gas general rate cases that were originally
filed on May 26, 2017. In the order, the WUTC approved new electric rates, effective on May 1, 2018, that increased base
rates by 2.2 percent (designed to increase electric revenues by $10.8 million). The net increase in electric base rates was
made up of an increase in our base revenue requirement of $23.2 million, an increase of $14.5 million in power supply
costs and a decrease of $26.9 million for the impacts of the TCJA, which reflects the federal income tax rate change from
35 percent to 21 percent and the amortization of the regulatory liability for plant excess deferred income taxes that was
recorded as of December 31, 2017.
While the WUTC authorized an increase in the ERM baseline to reflect increased power supply costs, it directed the
parties to examine the functionality and rationale of the Company's power cost modeling and adjust the baseline only in
extraordinary circumstances if necessary to more closely match the baseline to actual conditions.
For natural gas, the WUTC approved new natural gas base rates, effective on May 1, 2018, that decreased base rates by
2.4 percent (designed to decrease natural gas revenues by $2.1 million). The net decrease in natural gas base rates was
made up of an increase in base revenues of $3.4 million that was offset by a decrease of $5.5 million for the impacts from
the TCJA, which reflects the federal income tax rate change and the amortization of the regulatory liability for
plant-related excess deferred income taxes that was recorded as of December 31, 2017.
In addition to the above, the WUTC also ordered, effective June 1, 2018, a one-year temporary reduction of $7.9 million
in our revenue requirements for electric and $3.2 million for natural gas, reflecting reductions for the return of tax benefits
associated with the non-plant excess deferred income taxes and the customer refund liability that was established in 2018
related to the change in federal income tax expense for the period January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.

                                             Important Changes During the Quarter/Year
In our original filings, we requested three-year rate plans for electric and natural gas; however, in the final order the
WUTC only provided for new rates effective on May 1, 2018.
TCJA Proceedings
In February 2019, we filed an all-party settlement agreement with the WUTC related to the electric tax benefits associated
with the TCJA that were set aside for Colstrip in the 2017 general rate case order (effective May 1, 2018). In the
settlement agreement, the parties agreed to utilize $10.9 million of the electric tax benefits to offset costs associated with
accelerating the depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 & 4, to reflect a remaining useful life of those units through December
31, 2027. That portion of the settlement agreement was denied. The WUTC has indicated that it will review the TCJA and
Colstrip in our 2019 general rate case (discussed below).
2019 General Rate Cases
On March 25, 2020, the Company received an order from the WUTC that approved the partial multi-party settlement
agreement that was filed on November 21, 2019.
The approved rates are designed to increase annual base electric revenues by $28.5 million, or 5.7 percent, and annual
natural gas base revenues by $8.0 million, or 8.5 percent, effective April 1, 2020. The revenue increases are based on a 9.4
percent return on equity with a common equity ratio of 48.5 percent and a rate of return on rate base of 7.21 percent.
As part of the WUTC order, the Company will return approximately $40 million from the Energy Recovery Mechanism
(ERM) rebate to customers over a two-year period. The ERM rebate includes approximately $3 million that was recently
disallowed by the Commission for the cost of replacement power during an unplanned outage at the Colstrip generating
facility (Colstrip) in 2018. The Commission directed the Company to return a larger portion of the ERM money during the
first year to achieve a net-zero billed impact to electric customers.
Included in the WUTC order is the acceleration of depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 & 4, to reflect a remaining useful life
through December 31, 2025. The order utilizes certain electric tax benefits associated with the 2018 tax reform to partially
offset these increased costs. The order also sets aside $3 million for community transition efforts to mitigate the impacts
of the eventual closure of Colstrip, half funded by customers and half funded by Company shareholders.
In addition, a recent order received from the WUTC on the 2015 remand cases requires the Company to refund $8.5
million to electric and natural gas customers. The Company will refund $4.9 million to electric customers and $3.6 million
to natural gas customers over a one year period, which will partially offset the increase in base rates.
Lastly, the order includes the extension of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms through March 31, 2025.

2017 General Rate Cases
On December 28, 2017, the IPUC approved a settlement agreement between us and other parties to our electric and
natural gas general rate cases. New rates were effective on January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019.
The settlement agreement was a two-year rate plan and had the following electric and natural gas base rate changes each
year, which were designed to result in the following increases in annual revenues (dollars in millions):

The settlement agreement was based on a ROR of 7.61 percent with a common equity ratio of 50.0 percent and a 9.5
percent ROE.
TCJA Proceedings
On May 31, 2018, the IPUC approved an all-party settlement agreement related to the income tax benefits associated with
the TCJA. Effective June 1, 2018, current customer rates were reduced to reflect the reduction of the federal income tax
rate to 21 percent, and the amortization of the regulatory liability for plant-related excess deferred income taxes. This
reduction reduces annual electric rates by $13.7 million (or 5.3 percent reduction to base rates) and natural gas rates by
$2.6 million (or 6.1 percent reduction to base rates).
In March 2019, the IPUC approved an all-party settlement agreement related to the electric tax benefits that were set aside
for Colstrip in the 2017 general rate case order. In the approved settlement agreement, the parties agreed to utilize
approximately $6.4 million ($5.1 million when tax-effected) of the electric tax benefits to offset costs associated with
accelerating the depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 & 4, to reflect a remaining useful life of those units through December
31, 2027. The remaining tax benefits of approximately $5.8 million will be returned to customers through a temporary rate
reduction over a period of one year beginning on April 1, 2019. The tax benefits being utilized are related to non-plant
excess deferred income taxes, and the customer refund liability that was established in 2018 related to the change in
federal income tax expense for the period January 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018.
2019 General Rate Case
On October 11, 2019, Avista Corp. and all parties to our electric general rate case reached a settlement agreement that was
approved by the IPUC. New rates went into effect on December 1, 2019.
The rates that went into effect are designed to decrease annual base electric revenues by $7.2 million (or 2.8 percent),
effective December 1, 2019. The settlement revenue decreases are based on a 9.5 percent ROE with a common equity
ratio of 50 percent and a rate of return ROR on rate base of 7.35 percent, which is a continuation of current levels. This
outcome is in line with our expectations.
The primary element of the difference in the agreed upon base revenues in the settlement agreement from our original
request is that the settlement includes the continued recovery of costs for our wind generation power purchase agreements,
which will include Palouse Wind and Rattlesnake Flat, through the PCA mechanism rather than through base rates.
Our original request included an increase of annual electric base revenues of $5.3 million or 2.1 percent, effective January
1, 2020.
The electric request was based on a proposed ROR on rate base of 7.55 percent with a common equity ratio of 50 percent
and a 9.9 percent ROE, as well as the inclusion of wind power purchase costs in base rates rather than receiving recovery
through the PCA.

2019 General Rate Case
On October 9, 2019, the OPUC approved the all-party settlement agreements filed in the third quarter of 2019. New rates
went into effect on January 15, 2020.
OPUC approved rates that are designed to increase annual natural gas billed revenues by $3.6 million, or 4.2 percent.
The OPUC’s decision reflects a ROR on rate base of 7.24 percent, with a common equity ratio of 50 percent and a 9.4
percent ROE, both of which represent a continuation of existing authorized levels.
In addition, the approved settlement agreements included agreement among the parties to a future independent review of
our interest rate hedging practices, with any recommendations based on the results and findings in the final report to be
applicable only on a prospective basis and do not apply to any prior interest rate hedging activity.
TCJA Proceedings
In February 2019, the OPUC approved the deferral amount of $3.8 million related to 2018 income tax benefits associated
with the TCJA. The 2018 deferred benefits will be returned to customers through a temporary rate reduction over a period
of one year beginning March 1, 2019. We continued the deferral of the TCJA benefits during 2019 for later return to
customers, until such time as these changes can be reflected in base rates.

Schedule Page: 117 Line No.: 2 Column: c
During the first quarter of 2018, Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02 was adopted,
which resulted in a $1.7 million balance sheet only reclassification from Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Loss to account 439 - Adjustments to Retained Earnings. The
reclassification was the result of the change in federal income tax rates from 35 percent
to 21 percent. Usage of account 439 requires prior FERC approval. See Page 122 Note 2 for
further discussion of the adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 as well as the prior FERC approval.

                                                         Notes to Financial Statements
Avista Capital, a wholly owned non-regulated subsidiary of Avista Corp., is the parent company of all of the subsidiary companies
except AERC (and its subsidiaries).
Basis of Reporting
The financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company and have been prepared in accordance
with the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as set forth in its applicable Uniform System
of Accounts and published accounting releases, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). As required by the FERC, the Company accounts for its investment
in majority-owned subsidiaries on the equity method rather than consolidating the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of these
subsidiaries, as required by U.S. GAAP. The accompanying financial statements include the Company’s proportionate share of utility
plant and related operations resulting from its interests in jointly owned plants. In addition, under the requirements of the FERC, there
are differences from U.S. GAAP in the presentation of (1) current portion of long-term debt (2) assets and liabilities for cost of
removal of assets, (3) assets held for sale, (4) regulatory assets and liabilities, (5) deferred income taxes associated with accounts
other than utility property, plant and equipment, (6) comprehensive income, (7) unamortized debt issuance costs, (8) operating
revenues and resource costs associated with settled energy contracts that are “booked out” (not physically delivered), (9) non-service
portion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and (10) leases.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include:
                   determining the market value of energy commodity derivative assets and liabilities,
                   pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations,
                   contingent liabilities,
                   goodwill impairment testing for goodwill held at subsidiaries,
                   recoverability of regulatory assets, and
                   unbilled revenues.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on the financial
statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein.
System of Accounts
The accounting records of the Company’s utility operations are maintained in accordance with the uniform system of accounts
prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the state regulatory commissions in Washington, Idaho, Montana and Oregon.
Regulation
The Company is subject to state regulation in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. The Company is also subject to federal
regulation primarily by the FERC, as well as various other federal agencies with regulatory oversight of particular aspects of its
operations.

For utility operations, depreciation expense is estimated by a method of depreciation accounting utilizing composite rates for utility
plant. Such rates are designed to provide for retirements of properties at the expiration of their service lives. For utility operations, the
ratio of depreciation provisions to average depreciable property was as follows for the years ended December 31:
                                                                                           2019              2018

The average service lives for the following broad categories of utility plant in service are (in years):

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)
AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period. As
prescribed by regulatory authorities, AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant. The debt component of AFUDC is
credited against total interest expense in the Statements of Income in the line item “capitalized interest.” The equity component of
AFUDC is included in the Statement of Income in the line item “other expense (income)-net.” The Company is permitted, under
established regulatory rate practices, to recover the capitalized AFUDC, and a reasonable return thereon, through its inclusion in rate
base and the provision for depreciation after the related utility plant is placed in service. Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not
occur until the related utility plant is placed in service and included in rate base.
The WUTC and IPUC have authorized Avista Corp. to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return. Beginning in 2018, to the
extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC amounts calculated using the FERC formula, Avista Corp. capitalizes
the excess as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset associated with plant in service is amortized over the average useful life of
Avista Corp.' utility plant which is approximately 30 years. The regulatory asset associated with construction work in progress is not
amortized until the plant is placed in service. The OPUC does not allow the Company to capitalize AFUDC that exceeds the FERC
calculated rate.
The effective AFUDC rate was the following for the years ended December 31:
                                                                                           2019              2018

Reclassification of AFUDC to Comply with Required FERC Regulatory Reporting
During the third quarter of 2019, the FERC completed an audit of Avista Corp. that covered the period January 1, 2015 through
December 31, 2018. The FERC indicated that Avista’s method of deferring taxes on AFUDC Equity should be changed from
normalization to flow-through. Avista has historically normalized the AFUDC Equity book/tax timing difference by recognizing
deferred tax expense with the result of spreading the benefit over the book life of the asset. Under the flow-through method, Avista
will no longer recognize deferred tax expense on the AFUDC Equity timing difference and instead recognize a regulatory asset to be
reversed over the book life of the asset. The flow-through method does not impact revenue requirement. A regulatory asset was

recorded in 2018 for $1.7M to account for this change to the flow-through method on a prospective basis.
Additionally, Avista Corp.’s AFUDC rate, which is prescribed by state regulatory authorities, is different than the FERC approved
method for calculating AFUDC. The FERC indicated that the difference in rates should be recorded as a regulatory asset rather than
in utility plant. At the conclusion of the audit, the FERC required Avista Corp. to reclassify the excess AFUDC from Net utility plant
to Non-current regulatory assets for the period January 1, 2010 (the effective date of the Company’s current fixed transmission rates)
to the present. As a result, Avista Corp. reclassified approximately $33 million (net of accumulated depreciation) from Net utility
plant to Non-current regulatory assets as of December 31, 2019, which represents the cumulative adjustment for 2010 through 2017.
The Company recorded the difference in AFUDC rates for 2018 and 2019 as a regulatory asset in the respective periods incurred. The
Company did not adjust prior period Consolidated Balances Sheets since the FERC required the adjustment to be reflected on a
cumulative basis at the end of the audit and required the AFUDC calculation to be modified on a prospective basis. The Company
concluded that the differences were insignificant during each prior period and on a cumulative basis. The adjustment recorded during
2019 had no effect on net income or earnings per share.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets represent future income tax deductions the Company expects to utilize in future tax returns to reduce
taxable income. Deferred income tax liabilities represent future taxable income the Company expects to recognize in future tax
returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise when there are temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for
tax and accounting purposes. A deferred income tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates that will be in effect
when the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are
expected to be reported in the Company’s income tax returns. The deferred income tax expense for the period is equal to the net
change in the deferred income tax asset and liability accounts from the beginning to the end of the period. The effect on deferred
income taxes from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date unless a regulatory
order specifies deferral of the effect of the change in tax rates over a longer period of time. The Company establishes a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred income tax
liabilities and regulatory assets are established for income tax benefits flowed through to customers.
The Company's largest deferred income tax item is the difference between the book and tax basis of utility plant. This item results
from the temporary difference on depreciation expense. In early tax years, this item is recorded as a deferred income tax liability that
will eventually reverse and become subject to income tax in later tax years.
See Note 9 for discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and its impacts on the Company's financial statements, as well as a
tabular presentation of all the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company did not incur any penalties on income tax positions in 2019 or 2018. The Company would recognize interest accrued
related to income tax positions as interest expense and any penalties incurred as other income deductions.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company currently issues three types of stock-based compensation awards - restricted shares, market-based awards and
performance-based awards. Historically, these stock compensation awards have not been material to the Company's overall financial
results. Compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions is recognized in the Company’s financial statements based on
the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued and recorded over the requisite service period.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense (included in other operating expenses) and income tax benefits in the
Statements of Income of the following amounts for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):
                                                                                                           2019          2018

Restricted share awards vest in equal thirds each year over 3 years and are payable in Avista Corp. common stock at the end of each
year if the service condition is met. In addition to the service condition, for restricted shares granted in 2017, the Company must meet
a return on equity target in order for the Chief Executive Officer's restricted shares to vest. Restricted stock is valued at the close of
market of the Company’s common stock on the grant date.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) awards are market-based awards and Cumulative Earnings Per Share (CEPS) awards are
performance awards. Both types of awards vest after a period of 3 years and are payable in cash or Avista Corp. common stock at the
end of the three-year period. The method of settlement is at the discretion of the Company and historically the Company has settled
these awards through issuance of Avista Corp. common stock and intends to continue this practice. Both types of awards entitle the
recipients to dividend equivalent rights, are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances, and are subject to meeting specific
market or performance conditions. Based on the level of attainment of the market or performance conditions, the amount of cash paid
or common stock issued will range from 0 to 200 percent of the initial awards granted. Dividend equivalent rights are accumulated
and paid out only on shares that eventually vest and have met the market and performance conditions.
For both the TSR awards and the CEPS awards, the Company accounts for them as equity awards and compensation cost for these
awards is recognized over the requisite service period, provided that the requisite service period is rendered. For TSR awards, if the
market condition is not met at the end of the three-year service period, there will be no change in the cumulative amount of
compensation cost recognized, since the awards are still considered vested even though the market metric was not met. For CEPS
awards, at the end of the three-year service period, if the internal performance metric of cumulative earnings per share is not met, all
compensation cost for these awards is reversed as these awards are not considered vested.
The fair value of each TSR award is estimated on the date of grant using a statistical model that incorporates the probability of
meeting the market targets based on historical returns relative to a peer group. The estimated fair value of the equity component of
CEPS awards was estimated on the date of grant as the share price of Avista Corp. common stock on the date of grant, less the net
present value of the estimated dividends over the three-year period.

Outstanding TSR and CEPS share awards include a dividend component that is paid in cash. This component of the share grants is
accounted for as a liability award. These liability awards are revalued on a quarterly basis taking into account the number of awards
outstanding, historical dividend rate, the change in the value of the Company’s common stock relative to an external benchmark (TSR
awards only) and the amount of CEPS earned to date compared to estimated CEPS over the performance period (CEPS awards only).
Over the life of these awards, the cumulative amount of compensation expense recognized will match the actual cash paid. As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had recognized cumulative compensation expense and a liability of $0.9 million and $0.3
million, respectively, related to the dividend component on the outstanding and unvested share grants.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all temporary investments with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for estimated and potential losses on accounts receivable. The
Company determines the allowance for utility and other customer accounts receivable based on historical write-offs as compared to
accounts receivable and operating revenues. Additionally, the Company establishes specific allowances for certain individual
accounts.
Utility Plant in Service
The cost of additions to utility plant in service, including AFUDC and replacements of units of property and improvements, is
capitalized. The cost of depreciable units of property retired plus the cost of removal less salvage is charged to accumulated
depreciation.
Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)
The Company records the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially
recorded, the associated costs of the ARO are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is
accreted to its present value each period and the related capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. In
addition, if there are changes in the estimated timing or estimated costs of the AROs, adjustments are recorded during the period new
information becomes available as an increase or decrease to the liability, with the offset recorded to the related long-lived asset. Upon
retirement of the asset, the Company either settles the ARO for its recorded amount or recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the
difference, which will be surcharged/refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. The Company records regulatory assets
and liabilities for the difference between asset retirement costs currently recovered in rates and AROs recorded since asset retirement
costs are recovered through rates charged to customers (see Note 7 for further discussion of the Company's AROs).
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from acquisitions represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in a business
combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment using a

fair value to carrying amount comparison (Step 1) for AEL&P. The Company completed its annual evaluation of goodwill for
potential impairment as of November 30, 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired at that time (carrying value was less
than the determined fair value). There were no events or circumstances that changed between November 30, 2019 and December 31,
2019 that would more likely than not reduce the fair values of the reporting units below their carrying amounts. While, the Company
does not have any goodwill amounts recorded on its FERC balance sheets, it does have goodwill at its subsidiaries and the amounts
for goodwill are reflected in the investment in subsidiary companies.
The following amounts were recorded as goodwill at the subsidiary companies and reflected through the investment in subsidiary
companies on the FERC balance sheets (dollars in thousands):

Goodwill sold during the year relates to the sale of METALfx in April 2019. See Note 19 for further discussion. Accumulated
impairment losses were attributable to METALfx, which was a part of the other businesses.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities
Derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the Balance Sheets measured at estimated fair value.
The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) and the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) issued
accounting orders authorizing Avista Corp. to offset energy commodity derivative assets or liabilities with a regulatory asset or
liability. This accounting treatment is intended to defer the recognition of mark-to-market gains and losses on energy commodity
transactions until the period of delivery. Realized benefits and costs result in adjustments to retail rates through Purchased Gas
Adjustments (PGA), the Energy Recovery Mechanism (ERM) in Washington, the Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism in
Idaho, and periodic general rates cases. The resulting regulatory assets associated with energy commodity derivative instruments have
been concluded to be probable of recovery through future rates.
Substantially all forward contracts to purchase or sell power and natural gas are recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at estimated
fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. Contracts that are not considered derivatives are accounted for on the accrual
basis until they are settled or realized unless there is a decline in the fair value of the contract that is determined to be
other-than-temporary.
For interest rate swap derivatives, Avista Corp. records all mark-to-market gains and losses in each accounting period as assets and
liabilities, as well as offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities, such that there is no income statement impact. The interest rate swap
derivatives are risk management tools similar to energy commodity derivatives. Upon settlement of interest rate swap derivatives, the
regulatory asset or liability is amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the associated debt. The Company
records an offset of interest rate swap derivative assets and liabilities with regulatory assets and liabilities, based on the prior practice
of the commissions to provide recovery through the ratemaking process.
The Company has multiple master netting agreements with a variety of entities that allow for cross-commodity netting of derivative
agreements with the same counterparty (i.e. power derivatives can be netted with natural gas derivatives). In addition, some master
netting agreements allow for the netting of commodity derivatives and interest rate swap derivatives for the same counterparty. The
Company does not have any agreements which allow for cross-affiliate netting among multiple affiliated legal entities. The Company

nets all derivative instruments when allowed by the agreement for presentation in the Balance Sheets.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value represents the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Energy commodity derivative assets and liabilities, deferred
compensation assets, as well as derivatives related to interest rate swap derivatives and foreign currency exchange derivatives, are
reported at estimated fair value on the Balance Sheets. See Note 14 for the Company’s fair value disclosures.
Regulatory Deferred Charges and Credits
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with regulatory accounting practices because:
                    rates for regulated services are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators,
                    the regulated rates are designed to recover the cost of providing the regulated services, and
                    in view of demand for the regulated services and the level of competition, it is reasonable to assume that rates can
                     be charged to and collected from customers at levels that will recover costs.
Regulatory accounting practices require that certain costs and/or obligations (such as incurred power and natural gas costs not
currently reflected in rates, but expected to be recovered or refunded in the future), are reflected as deferred charges or credits on the
Balance Sheets. These costs and/or obligations are not reflected in the Statements of Income until the period during which matching
revenues are recognized. The Company also has decoupling revenue deferrals. Decoupling revenue deferrals are recognized in the
Statements of Income during the period they occur (i.e. during the period of revenue shortfall or excess due to fluctuations in
customer usage), subject to certain limitations, and a regulatory asset/liability is established which will be surcharged or rebated to
customers in future periods. GAAP requires that for any alternative regulatory revenue program, like decoupling, the revenue must be
expected to be collected from customers within 24 months of the deferral to qualify for recognition in the current period Statement of
Income. Any amounts included in the Company's decoupling program that are not expected to be collected from customers within 24
months are not recorded in the financial statements until the period in which revenue recognition criteria are met. This could
ultimately result in decoupling revenue that arose during the current year being recognized in a future period.
If at some point in the future the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of regulatory
accounting practices for all or a portion of its regulated operations, the Company could be:
                    required to write off its regulatory assets, and
                    precluded from the future deferral of costs or decoupled revenues not recovered through rates at the time such
                     amounts are incurred, even if the Company expected to recover these amounts from customers in the future.
Unamortized Debt Expense
Unamortized debt expense includes debt issuance costs that are amortized over the life of the related debt.
Unamortized Gain/Loss on Reacquired Debt
For the Company’s Washington regulatory jurisdiction and for any debt repurchases beginning in 2007 in all jurisdictions, premiums
or discounts paid to repurchase debt are amortized over the remaining life of the original debt that was repurchased or, if new debt is
issued in connection with the repurchase, these amounts are amortized over the life of the new debt. In the Company’s other
regulatory jurisdictions, premiums or discounts paid to repurchase debt prior to 2007 are being amortized over the average remaining
maturity of outstanding debt when no new debt was issued in connection with the debt repurchase. The premiums and discounts costs
are recovered or returned to customers through retail rates as a component of interest expense.

Appropriated Retained Earnings
In accordance with the hydroelectric licensing requirements of section 10(d) of the Federal Power Act (FPA), the Company maintains
an appropriated retained earnings account for any earnings in excess of the specified rate of return on the Company's investment in the
licenses for its various hydroelectric projects. Per section 10(d) of the FPA, the Company must maintain these excess earnings in an
appropriated retained earnings account until the termination of the licensing agreements or apply them to reduce the net investment in
the licenses of the hydroelectric projects at the discretion of the FERC. The Company calculates the earnings in excess of the
specified rate of return on an annual basis, usually during the second quarter.
The appropriated retained earnings amounts included in retained earnings were as follows as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):
                                                                                                             2019           2018

Contingencies
The Company has unresolved regulatory, legal and tax issues which have inherently uncertain outcomes. The Company accrues a loss
contingency if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss or impairment can be reasonably estimated.
The Company also discloses loss contingencies that do not meet these conditions for accrual, if there is a reasonable possibility that a
material loss may be incurred. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not recorded any significant amounts related to unresolved
contingencies. See Note 16 for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.
Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Subsidiaries
The Company records all the earnings (losses) from its subsidiaries under the equity method. The Company had the following equity
in earnings (losses) of its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):

NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)"
ASU No. 2018-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842"
ASU No. 2018-11, "Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements"
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, which outlines a model for entities to use in accounting for leases and
supersedes previous lease accounting guidance, as well as several practical expedients in ASU Nos. 2018-01 and 2018-11.
The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 utilizing a modified retrospective adoption method with the "package of three" and
hindsight practical expedients offered by the standard. The "package of three" provides for an entity to not reassess at adoption
whether any expired or existing contracts are deemed, for accounting purposes, to be or contain leases, the classification of any
expired or existing leases, and any initial direct costs for any existing leases. As a result, the Company did not reassess existing or

expired contracts under the new lease guidance, and it did not reassess the classification of any existing leases. The Company used the
benefit of hindsight in determining both term and impairments associated with any existing leases. Use of this practical expedient has
resulted in lease terms that best represent management's expectations with respect to use of the underlying asset but did not result in
recognition of any impairment.
The Company elected to adopt ASU No. 2018-01, which allows an entity to exclude from application of Topic 842 all easements
executed prior to January 1, 2019. In addition, the Company elected to adopt the "comparatives under 840" practical expedient offered
in ASU No. 2018-11, which allows an entity to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date, recognizing any necessary
cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption and presenting comparative periods
in the financial statements under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 840 (previous lease accounting guidance). Adoption of
the standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment within the Company's financial statements.
As allowed by ASU No. 2016-02, the Company elected not to apply the requirements of the standard to short-term leases, those leases
with an initial term of 12 months or less. These leases are not recorded on the balance sheet and are not material to the financial
statements.
Adoption of the standard impacted the Company's Balance Sheet through recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities
for the Company's operating leases. See Note 4 for further information on the Company's leases.
 ASU No. 2018-02 “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”
In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-02, which amended the guidance for
reporting comprehensive income. This ASU allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained
earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. This ASU is effective for periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the requirements of this ASU must be applied
either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal
corporate income tax rate in the TCJA is recognized. The Company early adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018 and elected
to apply the guidance during the period of adoption rather than apply the standard retrospectively. As a result, the Company
reclassified $1.7 million in tax benefits from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings during the year ended
December 31, 2018.
For regulatory reporting, the reclassification to retained earnings is reflected in FERC account 439 – Adjustments to Retained
Earnings. Per FERC Guidelines, the usage of account 439 requires prior FERC approval. During 2018, the Company filed a request
with FERC for approval of the usage of account 439, which was approved by the FERC on December 21, 2018. The docket number
for Avista Corp.’s request was AC19-9-000.
ASU 2018-13 "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)"
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, which amends the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820.
The requirements of this ASU include additional disclosure regarding the range and weighted average used to develop significant
unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value estimates and the elimination of certain other previously required disclosures, such as the
narrative description of the valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements. This ASU is effective for periods beginning after
December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. Entities have the option to early adopt the eliminated or modified disclosure
requirements and delay the adoption of all the new disclosure requirements until the effective date of the ASU. The Company is in the
process of evaluating this standard; however, it has determined that it will not early adopt any portion of this standard as of
December 31, 2019.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, which amends ASC 715 to add, remove and/or clarify certain disclosure
requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The additional disclosure requirements are primarily
narrative discussion of significant changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets. The removed disclosures are primarily
information about accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized over the next year and the effects of changes
associated with assumed health care costs. This ASU is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and early adoption is
permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating this standard; however, it has determined that it will not early adopt this
standard as of December 31, 2019.
NOTE 3. REVENUE
ASC 606 defines the core principle of the revenue recognition model is that an entity should identify the various performance
obligations in a contract, allocate the transaction price among the performance obligations and recognize revenue when (or as) the
entity satisfies each performance obligation.
Utility Revenues
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
General
The majority of Avista Corp.’s revenue is from rate-regulated sales of electricity and natural gas to retail customers, which has two
performance obligations, (1) having service available for a specified period (typically a month at a time) and (2) the delivery of
energy to customers. The total energy price generally has a fixed component (basic charge) related to having service available and a
usage-based component, related to the delivery and consumption of energy. The commodity is sold and/or delivered to and consumed
by the customer simultaneously, and the provisions of the relevant utility commission authorization determine the charges the
Company may bill the customer. Given that all revenue recognition criteria are met upon the delivery of energy to customers, revenue
is recognized immediately.
In addition, the sale of electricity and natural gas is governed by the various state utility commissions, which set rates, charges, terms
and conditions of service, and prices. Collectively, these rates, charges, terms and conditions are included in a “tariff,” which governs
all aspects of the provision of regulated services. Tariffs are only permitted to be changed through a rate-setting process involving an
independent, third-party regulator empowered by statute to establish rates that bind customers. Thus, all regulated sales by the
Company are conducted subject to the regulator-approved tariff.
Tariff sales involve the current provision of commodity service (electricity and/or natural gas) to customers for a price that generally
has a basic charge and a usage-based component. Tariff rates also include certain pass-through costs to customers such as natural gas
costs, retail revenue credits and other miscellaneous regulatory items that do not impact net income, but can cause total revenue to
fluctuate significantly up or down compared to previous periods. The commodity is sold and/or delivered to and consumed by the
customer simultaneously, and the provisions of the relevant tariff determine the charges the Company may bill the customer, payment
due date, and other pertinent rights and obligations of both parties. Generally, tariff sales do not involve a written contract. Given that
all revenue recognition criteria are met upon the delivery of energy to customers, revenue is recognized immediately at that time.
Unbilled Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The determination of the volume of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a
systematic basis throughout the month (once per month for each individual customer). At the end of each calendar month, the amount
of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is
estimated and recorded. The Company's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on:

                    the number of customers,
                    current rates,
                    meter reading dates,
                    actual native load for electricity,
                    actual throughput for natural gas, and
                    electric line losses and natural gas system losses.
Any difference between actual and estimated revenue is automatically corrected in the following month when the actual meter reading
and customer billing occurs.
Accounts receivable includes unbilled energy revenues of the following amounts as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):
                                                                                                          2019            2018
 Unbilled accounts receivable                                                                        $      60,560 $        64,463
Non-Derivative Wholesale Contracts
The Company has certain wholesale contracts which are not accounted for as derivatives that are within the scope of ASC 606 and
considered revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized as energy is delivered to the customer or the service is
available for specified period of time, consistent with the discussion of tariff sales above.
Alternative Revenue Programs (Decoupling)
ASC 606 retained existing GAAP associated with alternative revenue programs, which specified that alternative revenue programs are
contracts between an entity and a regulator of utilities, not a contract between an entity and a customer. GAAP requires that an entity
present revenue arising from alternative revenue programs separately from revenues arising from contracts with customers on the face
of the Statements of Income. The Company's decoupling mechanisms (also known as a FCA in Idaho) qualify as alternative revenue
programs. Decoupling revenue deferrals are recognized in the Statements of Income during the period they occur (i.e. during the
period of revenue shortfall or excess due to fluctuations in customer usage), subject to certain limitations, and a regulatory asset or
liability is established which will be surcharged or rebated to customers in future periods. GAAP requires that for any alternative
revenue program, like decoupling, the revenue must be expected to be collected from customers within 24 months of the deferral to
qualify for recognition in the current period Statement of Income. Any amounts included in the Company's decoupling program that
are not expected to be collected from customers within 24 months are not recorded in the financial statements until the period in
which revenue recognition criteria are met. The amounts expected to be collected from customers within 24 months represents an
estimate which must be made by the Company on an ongoing basis due to it being based on the volumes of electric and natural gas
sold to customers on a go-forward basis.
The Company records alternative program revenues under the gross method, which is to amortize the decoupling regulatory
asset/liability to the alternative revenue program line item on the Statement of Income as it is collected from or refunded to customers.
The cash passing between the Company and the customers is presented in revenue from contracts with customers since it is a portion
of the overall tariff paid by customers. This method results in a gross-up to both revenue from contracts with customers and revenue
from alternative revenue programs, but has a net zero impact on total revenue. Depending on whether the previous deferral balance
being amortized was a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, and depending on the size and direction of the current year deferral of
surcharges and/or rebates to customers, it could result in negative alternative revenue program revenue during the year.
Derivative Revenue
  FERC FORM NO. 2/3-Q (REV 12-07)                                     122.12

                                                        Notes to Financial Statements
Most wholesale electric and natural gas transactions (including both physical and financial transactions), and the sale of fuel are
considered derivatives, which are scoped out of ASC 606. As such, these revenues are disclosed separately from revenue from
contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized for these items upon the settlement/expiration of the derivative contract. Derivative
revenue includes those transactions which are entered into and settled within the same month.
Other Utility Revenue
Other utility revenue includes rent, revenues from the lineman training school, sales of materials, late fees and other charges that do
not represent contracts with customers. Other utility revenue also includes the provision for earnings sharing and the deferral and
amortization of refunds to customers associated with the TCJA, enacted in December 2017. This revenue is scoped out of ASC 606,
as this revenue does not represent items where a customer is a party that has contracted with the Company to obtain goods or services
that are an output of the Company’s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration. As such, these revenues are presented
separately from revenue from contracts with customers.
Other Considerations for Utility Revenues
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
In addition to the tariff sales described above, which are stand-alone energy sales, the Company has bundled arrangements which
contain multiple performance obligations including some combination of energy, capacity, energy reserves and RECs. Under these
arrangements, the total contract price is allocated to the various performance obligations and revenue is recognized as the obligations
are satisfied. Depending on the source of the revenue, it could either be included in revenue from contracts with customers or
derivative revenue.
Gross Versus Net Presentation
Utility-related taxes collected from customers (primarily state excise taxes and city utility taxes) are taxes that are imposed on Avista
Corp. as opposed to being imposed on its customers; therefore, Avista Corp. is the taxpayer and records these transactions on a gross
basis in revenue from contracts with customers and operating expense (taxes other than income taxes).
Utility-related taxes that were included in revenue from contracts with customers were as follows for the years ended December 31
(dollars in thousands):
                                                                                                         2019           2018
 Utility-related taxes                                                                             $      59,528 $       58,730
Significant Judgments and Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
The vast majority of the Company's revenues are derived from the rate-regulated sale of electricity and natural gas that have two
performance obligations that are satisfied throughout the period and as energy is delivered to customers. In addition, the customers do
not pay for energy in advance of receiving it. As such, the Company does not have any significant unsatisfied performance
obligations or deferred revenues as of period-end associated with these revenues. Also, the only significant judgments involving
revenue recognition are estimates surrounding unbilled revenue and receivables from contracts with customers (discussed in detail
above) and estimates surrounding the amount of decoupling revenues which will be collected from customers within 24 months.
The Company has certain capacity arrangements, where the Company has a contractual obligation to provide either electric or natural
gas capacity to its customers for a fixed fee. Most of these arrangements are paid for in arrears by the customers and do not result in
deferred revenue and only result in receivables from the customers. The Company does have one capacity agreement where the
customer makes payments throughout the year and depending on the timing of the customer payments, it can result in an immaterial
amount of deferred revenue or a receivable from the customer. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates it had unsatisfied

the customers. These performance obligations are not reflected in the financial statements, as the Company has not received payment

NOTE 4. LEASES
ASC 842, which outlines a model for entities to use in accounting for leases and supersedes previous lease accounting guidance,
became effective on January 1, 2019. The core principle of the model is that an entity should recognize the ROU assets and liabilities
that arise from leases on the balance sheet and depreciate or amortize the asset and liability over the term of the lease, as well as
provide disclosure to enable users of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases. For regulatory reporting, the FERC provided prescribed accounts for the ROU assets and lease liabilities, with the ROU assets
being included in utility plant (FERC account 101) and the lease liabilities being included in capital lease obligations (FERC account
227). These accounts are different than the accounts allowed for in GAAP reporting, which results in a FERC/GAAP difference.
Significant Judgments and Assumptions
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, as well as its classification, at its inception.
ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the
commencement date of the agreement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's
leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the
commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when it is readily determinable. The
operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives, if any, that accrue to the benefit of the
lessee.
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that
option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any difference between lease
expense and cash paid for leased assets is recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.
Description of Leases
Operating Leases
The Company's most significant operating lease is with the State of Montana associated with submerged land around the Company's
hydroelectric facilities in the Clark Fork River basin, which expires in 2046. The terms of this lease are subject to renegotiation,
depending on the outcome of ongoing litigation between Montana and NorthWestern Energy. In addition, the State of Montana and
Avista Corp. are engaged in litigation regarding lease terms, including how much money, if any, the State of Montana will return to
Avista Corp. The Company is currently paying all lease payments to the State of Montana into an escrow account until the litigation is
resolved. As such, amounts recorded for this lease are uncertain and amounts may change in the future depending on the outcome of
the ongoing litigation. Any reduction in future lease payments or the return of previously paid amounts to Avista Corp. will be
included in the future ratemaking process.
In addition to the lease with the State of Montana, the Company also has other operating leases for land associated with its utility
operations, as well as communication sites which support network and radio communications within its service territory. The
Company's leases have remaining terms of 1 to 74 years. Most of the Company's leases include options to extend the lease term for
periods of 5 to 50 years. Options are exercised at the Company's discretion.

                                                       Notes to Financial Statements
Certain of the Company's lease agreements include rental payments which are periodically adjusted over the term of the agreement
based on the consumer price index. The Company's lease agreements do not include any material residual value guarantees or material
restrictive covenants.
Avista Corp. does not record leases with a term of 12 months or less in the Balance Sheet. Total short-term lease costs for the year
ended December 31, 2019 are immaterial.
Leases that Have Not Yet Commenced
In March 2019, the Company signed a PPA with Clearway Energy Group (Clearway) to purchase all of the power generated from the
Rattlesnake Flat Wind project in Adams County, Washington. The facility has a nameplate capacity of 144 MW and is expected to
generate approximately 50 aMW annually. During negotiations with Clearway, Avista Corp. was involved in the selection of the
preferred generation facility type. The PPA is a 20-year agreement with deliveries expected to begin in 2020. The PPA
provides Avista Corp. with additional renewable energy, capacity and environmental attributes. Avista Corp. expects to recover the
cost of the power purchased through its retail rates. This PPA is considered a lease under ASC 842; however, all of the payments are
variable payments based on whether power is generated from the facility. Since all the payments are variable, the Company will not
record a lease liability for the agreement, but the expense will be included in resource costs when it becomes operational in 2020.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Energy Commodity Derivatives
Avista Corp. is exposed to market risks relating to changes in electricity and natural gas commodity prices and certain other fuel
prices. Market risk is, in general, the risk of fluctuation in the market price of the commodity being traded and is influenced primarily
by supply and demand. Market risk includes the fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments.
Avista Corp. utilizes derivative instruments, such as forwards, futures, swap derivatives and options in order to manage the various

risks relating to these commodity price exposures. Avista Corp. has an energy resources risk policy and control procedures to manage
these risks.
As part of Avista Corp.'s resource procurement and management operations in the electric business, the Company engages in an
ongoing process of resource optimization, which involves the economic selection from available energy resources to serve Avista
Corp.'s load obligations and the use of these resources to capture available economic value through wholesale market transactions.
These include sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, fuel for electric generation, and derivative contracts related to
capacity, energy and fuel. Such transactions are part of the process of matching resources with load obligations and hedging a portion
of the related financial risks. These transactions range from terms of intra-hour up to multiple years.
As part of its resource procurement and management of its natural gas business, Avista Corp. makes continuing projections of its
natural gas loads and assesses available natural gas resources including natural gas storage availability. Natural gas resource planning
typically includes peak requirements, low and average monthly requirements and delivery constraints from natural gas supply
locations to Avista Corp.'s distribution system. However, daily variations in natural gas demand can be significantly different than
monthly demand projections. On the basis of these projections, Avista Corp. plans and executes a series of transactions to hedge a
portion of its projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments. These transactions
may extend as much as three natural gas operating years (November through October) into the future. Avista Corp. also leaves a
significant portion of its natural gas supply requirements unhedged for purchase in short-term and spot markets.
Avista Corp. plans for sufficient natural gas delivery capacity to serve its retail customers for a theoretical peak day event. Avista
Corp. generally has more pipeline and storage capacity than what is needed during periods other than a peak day. Avista Corp.
optimizes its natural gas resources by using market opportunities to generate economic value that helps mitigate fixed costs. Avista
Corp. also optimizes its natural gas storage capacity by purchasing and storing natural gas when prices are traditionally lower,
typically in the summer, and withdrawing during higher priced months, typically during the winter. However, if market conditions
and prices indicate that Avista Corp. should buy or sell natural gas during other times in the year, Avista Corp. engages in
optimization transactions to capture value in the marketplace. Natural gas optimization activities include, but are not limited to,
wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies, purchases and sales of natural gas to optimize use of pipeline and storage
capacity, and participation in the transportation capacity release market.

As of December 31, 2018, there were no expected deliveries of energy commodity derivatives after 2021.
(1)    Physical transactions represent commodity transactions in which Avista Corp. will take or make delivery of either electricity or
        natural gas; financial transactions represent derivative instruments with delivery of cash in the amount of the benefit or cost but
        with no physical delivery of the commodity, such as futures, swap derivatives, options, or forward contracts.
The electric and natural gas derivative contracts above will be included in either power supply costs or natural gas supply costs during
the period they are delivered and will be included in the various deferral and recovery mechanisms (ERM, PCA, and PGAs), or in the
general rate case process, and are expected to be collected through retail rates from customers.
Foreign Currency Exchange Derivatives
A significant portion of Avista Corp.'s natural gas supply (including fuel for power generation) is obtained from Canadian sources.
Most of those transactions are executed in U.S. dollars, which avoids foreign currency risk. A portion of Avista Corp.’s short-term
natural gas transactions and long-term Canadian transportation contracts are committed based on Canadian currency prices and settled
within 60 days with U.S. dollars. Avista Corp. hedges a portion of the foreign currency risk by purchasing Canadian currency
exchange derivatives when such commodity transactions are initiated. The foreign currency exchange derivatives and the unhedged
foreign currency risk have not had a material effect on Avista Corp.’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and these
differences in cost related to currency fluctuations are included with natural gas supply costs for ratemaking.

Interest Rate Swap Derivatives
Avista Corp. is affected by fluctuating interest rates related to a portion of its existing debt, and future borrowing requirements. Avista
Corp. hedges a portion of its interest rate risk with financial derivative instruments. These financial derivative instruments are
considered economic hedges against fluctuations in future cash flows associated with anticipated debt issuances.

See Note 12 for discussion of the bond purchase agreement and the related settlement of interest rate swaps in connection with the
pricing of the bonds in September 2019.
The fair value of outstanding interest rate swap derivatives can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total
notional amount of swap derivatives outstanding and fluctuations in market interest rates compared to the interest rates fixed by the
swaps. Avista Corp. is required to make cash payments to settle the interest rate swap derivatives when the fixed rates are higher than
prevailing market rates at the date of settlement. Conversely, Avista Corp. receives cash to settle its interest rate swap derivatives
when prevailing market rates at the time of settlement exceed the fixed swap rates.

Exposure to Demands for Collateral
Avista Corp.'s derivative contracts often require collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit) or other credit enhancements, or
reductions or terminations of a portion of the contract through cash settlement. In the event of a downgrade in Avista Corp.'s credit
ratings or changes in market prices, additional collateral may be required. In periods of price volatility, the level of exposure can
change significantly. As a result, sudden and significant demands may be made against Avista Corp.'s credit facilities and cash. Avista
Corp. actively monitors the exposure to possible collateral calls and takes steps to mitigate capital requirements.
The following table presents Avista Corp.'s collateral outstanding related to its derivative instruments as of December 31 (in
thousands):

There were no letters of credit outstanding related to interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Certain of Avista Corp.’s derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to maintain an "investment grade" credit
rating from the major credit rating agencies. If Avista Corp.’s credit ratings were to fall below “investment grade,” it would be in
violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand
immediate and ongoing collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.

in a liability position and the amount of additional collateral Avista Corp. could be required to post as of December 31 (in thousands):

NOTE 6. JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITIES
The Company has a 15 percent ownership interest in a twin-unit coal-fired generating facility, Colstrip, located in southeastern
Montana, and provides financing for its ownership interest in the project. The Company’s share of related fuel costs as well as
operating expenses for plant in service are included in the corresponding accounts in the Statements of Income. The Company’s share
of utility plant in service for Colstrip and accumulated depreciation (inclusive of the ARO assets and accumulated amortization) were
as follows as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):
                                                                                                             2019           2018

See Note 7 for further discussion of AROs.
While the obligations and liabilities with respect to Colstrip are to be shared among the co-owners on a pro-rata basis, many of the
environmental liabilities are joint and several under the law, so that if any co-owner failed to pay its share of such liability, the other
co-owners (or any one of them) could be required to pay the defaulting co-owner‘s share (or the entire liability).
NOTE 7. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The Company has recorded liabilities for future AROs to:
                   restore coal ash containment ponds and coal holding areas at Colstrip,
                   cap a landfill at the Kettle Falls Plant, and
                   remove plant and restore the land at the Coyote Springs 2 site at the termination of the land lease.
Due to an inability to estimate a range of settlement dates, the Company cannot estimate a liability for the:
                   removal and disposal of certain transmission and distribution assets, and
                   abandonment and decommissioning of certain hydroelectric generation and natural gas storage facilities.
In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule regarding CCRs. Colstrip, of which Avista Corp. is a 15 percent owner of units 3 & 4, produces
this byproduct. The CCR rule has been the subject of ongoing litigation. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit struck down provisions of
the rule. The rule includes technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments. The Colstrip owners developed a
multi-year compliance plan to address the CCR requirements and existing state obligations.
The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the
ARO due to the uncertainty and evolving nature of the compliance strategies that will be used and the availability of data used to
estimate costs, such as the quantity of coal ash present at certain sites and the volume of fill that will be needed to cap and cover

certain impoundments. The Company updates its estimates as new information becomes available. The Company expects to seek
recovery of any increased costs related to complying with the CCR rule through customer rates.
In addition to the above, under a 2018 Administrative Order on Consent and ongoing negotiations with the Montana Department of
Ecological Quality, the owners of Colstrip are required to provide financial assurance, primarily in the form of surety bonds, to secure
each owner's pro-rata share of various anticipated closure and remediation of the ash ponds and coal holding areas. The amount of
financial assurance required of each owner may, like the ARO, vary substantially due to the uncertainty and evolving nature of
anticipated closure and remediation activities, and as those activities are completed over time.

NOTE 8. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The pension and other postretirement benefit plans described below only relate to Avista Corp.. AEL&P (not discussed below)
participates in a defined contribution multiemployer plan for its union workers and a defined contribution money purchase pension
plan for its nonunion workers. None of the subsidiary retirement plans, individually or in the aggregate, are significant to Avista Corp.
Avista Corp.
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering the majority of all regular full-time employees at Avista Corp. that were
hired prior to January 1, 2014. Individual benefits under this plan are based upon the employee’s years of service, date of hire and
average compensation as specified in the plan. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 participate in a defined
contribution 401(k) plan in lieu of a defined benefit pension plan. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute at least the
minimum amounts that are required to be funded under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, but not more than the
maximum amounts that are currently deductible for income tax purposes. The Company contributed $22.0 million in cash to the
pension plan in 2019 and 2018. The Company expects to contribute $22.0 million in cash to the pension plan in 2020.
The Company also has a SERP that provides additional pension benefits to certain executive officers and certain key employees of the
Company. The SERP is intended to provide benefits to individuals whose benefits under the defined benefit pension plan are reduced
due to the application of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the deferral of salary under deferred compensation
plans. The liability and expense for this plan are included as pension benefits in the tables included in this Note.
The Company expects that benefit payments under the pension plan and the SERP will total (dollars in thousands):
                                             2020           2021            2022          2023           2024        Total 2025-2029
 Expected benefit payments              $     39,647 $       40,080 $        40,652 $      40,729 $        41,767 $         217,899
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments
held by the plan. In selecting a discount rate, the Company considers yield rates for highly rated corporate bond portfolios with
maturities similar to that of the expected term of pension benefits.

                                                         Notes to Financial Statements
The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees that were hired prior to January 1,
2014. The Company accrues the estimated cost of postretirement benefit obligations during the years that employees provide services.
The liability and expense of this plan are included as other postretirement benefits. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1,
2014, will have access to the retiree medical plan upon retirement; however, Avista Corp. will no longer provide a contribution
toward their medical premium.
The Company has a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) to provide employees with tax-advantaged funds to pay for
allowable medical expenses upon retirement. The amount earned by the employee is fixed on the retirement date based on the
employee’s years of service and the ending salary. The liability and expense of the HRA are included as other postretirement benefits.
The Company provides death benefits to beneficiaries of executive officers who die during their term of office or after retirement.
Under the plan, an executive officer’s designated beneficiary will receive a payment equal to twice the executive officer’s annual base
salary at the time of death (or if death occurs after retirement, a payment equal to twice the executive officer’s total annual pension
benefit). The liability and expense for this plan are included as other postretirement benefits.
The Company expects that benefit payments under other postretirement benefit plans will total (dollars in thousands):

The Company expects to contribute $6.7 million to other postretirement benefit plans in 2020, representing expected benefit payments
to be paid during the year excluding the Medicare Part D subsidy. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its
pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

(a) Total service costs in the table above are recorded to the same accounts as labor expense. Labor and benefits expense is recorded
     to various projects based on whether the work is a capital project or an operating expense. Approximately
     40 percent of all labor and benefits is capitalized to utility property and 60 percent is expensed to utility other operating expenses.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A
one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 by $13.9 million and the service and interest cost by $0.8 million. A one-percentage-point
decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 2019 by $10.7 million and the service and interest cost by $0.6 million.
Plan Assets
The Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approves investment policies, objectives and strategies that seek an
appropriate return for the pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans and reviews and approves changes to the investment and
funding policies.
The Company has contracted with investment consultants who are responsible for monitoring the individual investment managers.
The investment managers’ performance and related individual fund performance is periodically reviewed by an internal benefits
committee and by the Finance Committee to monitor compliance with investment policy objectives and strategies.
Pension plan assets are invested in mutual funds, trusts and partnerships that hold marketable debt and equity securities, real estate,
absolute return and commodity funds. In seeking to obtain a return that aligns with the funded status of the pension plan, the
investment consultant recommends allocation percentages by asset classes. These recommendations are reviewed by the internal
benefits committee, which then recommends their adoption by the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee has established target
investment allocation percentages by asset classes and also investment ranges for each asset class. The target investment allocation
percentages are typically the midpoint of the established range. The target investment allocation percentages by asset classes are
indicated in the table below:
                                                                                                                2019               2018

The fair value of pension plan assets invested in debt and equity securities was based primarily on fair value (market prices). The fair
value of investment securities traded on a national securities exchange is determined based on the reported last sales price; securities
traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last reported bid price. Investment securities for which market prices are not
readily available or for which market prices do not represent the value at the time of pricing, the investment manager estimates fair
value based upon other inputs (including valuations of securities that are comparable in coupon, rating, maturity and industry).
Pension plan and other postretirement plan assets whose fair values are measured using net asset value (NAV) are excluded from the
fair value hierarchy and are included as reconciling items in the tables below.
Investments in common/collective trust funds are presented at estimated fair value, which is determined based on the unit value of the
fund. Unit value is determined by an independent trustee, which sponsors the fund, by dividing the fund’s net assets by its units
outstanding at the valuation date. The Company's investments in common/collective trusts have redemption limitations that permit
quarterly redemptions following notice requirements of 45 to 60 days. The fair values of the closely held investments and partnership
interests are based upon the allocated share of the fair value of the underlying net assets as well as the allocated share of the
undistributed profits and losses, including realized and unrealized gains and losses. Most of the Company's investments in closely
held investments and partnership interests have redemption limitations that range from bi-monthly to semi-annually following
redemption notice requirements of 60 to 90 days. One investment in a partnership has a lock-up for redemption currently expiring in
2022 and is subject to extension.
The fair value of pension plan assets invested in real estate was determined by the investment manager based on three basic
approaches:
                    properties are externally appraised on an annual basis by independent appraisers, additional appraisals may be
                     performed as warranted by specific asset or market conditions,
                    property valuations are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary, and
                    loans are reflected at fair value.
The fair value of pension plan assets was determined as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

NOTE 9. ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES
Federal Income Tax Law Changes
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The legislation included substantial changes to the taxation of individuals as
well as U.S. businesses, multi-national enterprises, and other types of taxpayers. Highlights of provisions most relevant to Avista
Corp. included:
         A permanent reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, beginning with tax years after 2017;
         Statutory provisions requiring that excess deferred taxes associated with public utility property be normalized using the
          Average Rate Assumption Method (ARAM) or the Reverse South Georgia Method for determining the timing of the return
          of excess deferred taxes to customers. Excess deferred taxes result from revaluing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on

          the newly enacted tax rate instead of the previous tax rate, which, for most rate-regulated utilities like Avista Corp., results in
          a net benefit to customers that will be deferred as a regulatory liability and passed through to customers over future periods;
         Repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT);
         Bonus depreciation (expensing of capital investment on an accelerated basis) was removed as a deduction for property
          predominantly used in certain rate-regulated businesses (like Avista Corp.), but is still allowed for the Company's
          non-regulated businesses; and
         NOL carryback deductions were eliminated, but carryforward deductions are allowed indefinitely with some annual
          limitations versus the previous 20-year limitation.
As a result of the TCJA and its reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent (among many other changes
in the law), the Company recorded a regulatory liability associated with the revaluing of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities
to the new corporate tax rate. The total net amount of the regulatory liability for excess deferred income taxes associated with the
TCJA is $409.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $429.3 million as of December 31, 2018, which reflects the amounts
to be refunded to customers through the regulatory process. The Avista Corp. amounts related to utility plant commenced being
returned to customers in 2018 and the Company expects they will be returned to customers over a period of approximately 36 years
using the ARAM. The return of the regulatory liability attributable to non-plant excess deferred taxes has begun through tariffs or
other regulatory mechanisms or proceedings.
Because most of the provisions of the TCJA were effective as of January 1, 2018 but customers' rates included a 35 percent corporate
tax rate built in from prior general rate cases, the Company began accruing for a refund to customers for the change in federal income
tax expense beginning January 1, 2018 forward. For Washington and Idaho, this accrual was recorded until all benefits prior to a
permanent rate change were properly captured through the deferral process. For Oregon, this accrual was recorded through 2019 with
new customer rates effective January 15, 2020. Refunds have begun to Washington, Idaho, and Oregon customers through tariffs or
other regulatory mechanisms or proceedings.

Positive amounts reflect increases to the provision for deferred income taxes and negative amounts reflect reductions to the provision
for deferred income taxes.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and tax credit carryforwards.
The realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The Company
evaluated available evidence supporting the realization of its deferred income tax assets and determined it is more likely than not that
deferred income tax assets will be realized.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $22.3 million of state tax credit carryforwards. Of the total amount, the Company
believes that it is more likely than not that it will only be able to utilize $6.0 million of the state tax credits. As such, the Company has
recorded a valuation allowance of $16.3 million against the state tax credit carryforwards and reflected the net amount of $6.0 million
as an asset as of December 31, 2019. State tax credits expire from 2020 to 2033.
Status of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and State Examinations
The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns. The Company also files state income tax
returns in certain jurisdictions, including Idaho, Oregon, and Montana. Subsidiaries are charged or credited with the tax effects of
their operations on a stand-alone basis. All tax years after 2016 are open for an IRS tax examination.
The Idaho State Tax Commission is currently reviewing tax years 2014 through 2017. The statute of limitations for Montana and
Oregon to review 2015 and earlier tax years has expired.
The Company believes that any open tax years for federal or state income taxes will not result in adjustments that would be significant
to the financial statements.

These energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of Avista Corp.’ obligation to serve its retail electric and natural gas
customers’ energy requirements, including contracts entered into for resource optimization. As a result, these costs are recovered
either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost deferral and recovery
mechanisms.
The above future contractual commitments for power resources include fixed contractual amounts related to the Company's contracts
with certain Public Utility Districts (PUD) to purchase portions of the output of certain generating facilities. Although Avista Corp.
has no investment in the PUD generating facilities, the fixed contracts obligate Avista Corp. to pay certain minimum amounts whether
or not the facilities are operating. The cost of power obtained under the contracts, including payments made when a facility is not
operating, is included in utility resource costs in the Statements of Income. The contractual amounts included above consist of Avista
Corp.’ share of existing debt service cost and its proportionate share of the variable operating expenses of these projects. The
minimum amounts payable under these contracts are based in part on the proportionate share of the debt service requirements of the
PUD's revenue bonds for which the Company is indirectly responsible. The Company's total future debt service obligation associated
with the revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2019 (principal and interest) was $67.2 million.
In addition, Avista Corp. has operating agreements, settlements and other contractual obligations related to its generating facilities and
transmission and distribution services. The expenses associated with these agreements are reflected as other operating expenses in the
Statements of Income. The following table details future contractual commitments under these agreements (dollars in thousands):

NOTE 11. NOTES PAYABLE
Avista Corp. has a committed line of credit with various financial institutions in the total amount of $400.0 million that expires in
April 2021. The committed line of credit is secured by non-transferable first mortgage bonds of Avista Corp. issued to the agent bank
that would only become due and payable in the event, and then only to the extent, that Avista Corp. defaults on its obligations under
the committed line of credit.
The committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions. The credit agreement has a covenant
which does not permit the ratio of “consolidated total debt” to “consolidated total capitalization” of Avista Corp. to be greater than 65
percent at any time. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with this covenant.
Balances outstanding and interest rates of borrowings (excluding letters of credit) under the Company’s revolving committed lines of
credit were as follows as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):

           Corp. is the holder of these bonds, the bonds will not be reflected as an asset or a liability on Avista Corp.'s Balance Sheets.
(2)        In November 2019, the Company issued and sold $180.0 million of 3.43 percent first mortgage bonds due in 2049 pursuant
           to a bond purchase agreement with institutional investors in the private placement market. The total net proceeds from the
           sale of the bonds were used to repay maturing long-term debt of $90.0 million, repay a portion of the outstanding balance
           under Avista Corp.'s $400.0 million committed line of credit and for other general corporate purposes. In connection with the
           issuance and sale of the first mortgage bonds, the Company cash settled six interest rate swap derivatives (notional aggregate
           amount of $70.0 million) and paid a net amount of $13.3 million. See note 5 for a discussion of interest rate swap
           derivatives.
The following table details future long-term debt maturities including long-term debt to affiliated trusts (see Note 13) (dollars in
thousands):
                                  2020           2021          2022            2023            2024          Thereafter       Total

Substantially all of Avista Corp.'s owned properties are subject to the lien of its mortgage indenture. Under the Mortgage and Deed of
Trust (Mortgage) securing its first mortgage bonds (including secured medium-term notes), Avista Corp. may each issue additional
first mortgage bonds under its mortgage in an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of:
          66-2/3 percent of the cost or fair value (whichever is lower) of property additions which have not previously been made the
           basis of any application under the Mortgage, or
          an equal principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds which have not previously been made the basis of any application
           under the Mortgage, or
          deposit of cash.
Avista Corp. may not issue any additional first mortgage bonds (with certain exceptions in the case of bonds issued on the basis of
retired bonds) unless it has “net earnings” (as defined in the Mortgage) for any period of 12 consecutive calendar months out of the
preceding 18 calendar months that were at least twice the annual interest requirements on all mortgage securities at the time
outstanding, including the first mortgage bonds to be issued, and on all indebtedness of prior rank. As of December 31, 2019,
property additions and retired bonds would have allowed, and the net earnings test would not have prohibited, the issuance of $1.5
billion in an aggregate principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds at Avista Corp.

$51.5 million to Avista Capital II, an affiliated business trust formed by the Company. Avista Capital II issued $50.0 million of
Preferred Trust Securities with a floating distribution rate of LIBOR plus 0.875 percent, calculated and reset quarterly.
The distribution rates paid were as follows during the years ended December 31:
                                                                                           2019              2018

the Company. These Preferred Trust Securities may be redeemed at the option of Avista Capital II at any time and mature on June 1,
2037. In December 2000, the Company purchased $10.0 million of these Preferred Trust Securities.
The Company owns 100 percent of Avista Capital II and has solely and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of distributions on,
and redemption price and liquidation amount for, the Preferred Trust Securities to the extent that Avista Capital II has funds available
for such payments from the respective debt securities. Upon maturity or prior redemption of such debt securities, the Preferred Trust
Securities will be mandatorily redeemed.
NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, special deposits, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and notes payable
are reasonable estimates of their fair values. Bonds and advances from associated companies are reported at carrying value on the
Balance Sheets.
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
       Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Active markets are those in which
transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
       Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, but which are either directly or
indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other
valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted
forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying
instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace
throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which
transactions are executed in the marketplace.
       Level 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally unobservable from objective sources. These inputs may be
used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment,
and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The
determination of the fair values incorporates various factors that not only include the credit standing of the counterparties involved
and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit), but also the impact of Avista Corp.’s
nonperformance risk on its liabilities.
The following table sets forth the carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments not reported at
estimated fair value on the Balance Sheets as of December 31 (dollars in thousands):

 Long-term debt (Level 3)                                                  857,000         946,674         677,000         645,523

These estimates of fair value of long-term debt and long-term debt to affiliated trusts were primarily based on available market
information, which generally consists of estimated market prices from third party brokers for debt with similar risk and terms. The
price ranges obtained from the third party brokers consisted of par values of 80.00 to 134.11, where a par value of 100.00 represents
the carrying value recorded on the Balance Sheets. Level 2 long-term debt represents publicly issued bonds with quoted market
prices; however, due to their limited trading activity, they are classified as Level 2 because brokers must generate quotes and make
estimates using comparable debt with similar risk and terms if there is no trading activity near a period end. Level 3 long-term debt
consists of private placement bonds and debt to affiliated trusts, which typically have no secondary trading activity. Fair values in
Level 3 are estimated based on market prices from third party brokers using secondary market quotes for debt with similar risk and
terms to generate quotes for Avista Corp. bonds.

(1) The Company is permitted to net derivative assets and derivative liabilities with the same counterparty when a legally enforceable
     master netting agreement exists. In addition, the Company nets derivative assets and derivative liabilities against any payables
     and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with these same counterparties.
The difference between the amount of derivative assets and liabilities disclosed in respective levels in the table above and the amount
of derivative assets and liabilities disclosed on the Balance Sheets is due to netting arrangements with certain counterparties. See Note
5 for additional discussion of derivative netting.
To establish fair value for energy commodity derivatives, the Company uses quoted market prices and forward price curves to
estimate the fair value of energy commodity derivative instruments included in Level 2. In particular, electric derivative valuations are
performed using market quotes, adjusted for periods in between quotable periods. Natural gas derivative valuations are estimated
using New York Mercantile Exchange pricing for similar instruments, adjusted for basin differences, using market quotes. Where
observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, the derivative asset or liability is included in Level 2.
To establish fair values for interest rate swap derivatives, the Company uses forward market curves for interest rates for the term of
the swaps and discounts the cash flows back to present value using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is calculated by
third party brokers according to the terms of the swap derivatives and evaluated by the Company for reasonableness, with

consideration given to the potential non-performance risk by the Company. Future cash flows of the interest rate swap derivatives are
equal to the fixed interest rate in the swap compared to the floating market interest rate multiplied by the notional amount for each
period.
To establish fair value for foreign currency derivatives, the Company uses forward market curves for Canadian dollars against the US
dollar and multiplies the difference between the locked-in price and the market price by the notional amount of the derivative.
Forward foreign currency market curves are provided by third party brokers. The Company's credit spread is factored into the
locked-in price of the foreign exchange contracts.
Deferred compensation assets and liabilities represent funds held by the Company in a Rabbi Trust for an executive deferral plan.
These funds consist of actively traded equity and bond funds with quoted prices in active markets. The balance disclosed in the table
above excludes cash and cash equivalents of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2018.
Level 3 Fair Value
Under the power exchange agreement, which expired on June 30, 2019, the Company purchased power at a price that was based on
the average operating and maintenance (O&M) charges from three surrogate nuclear power plants around the country. To estimate the
fair value of this agreement the Company estimated the difference between the purchase price based on the future O&M charges and
forward prices for energy. The Company compared the Level 2 brokered quotes and forward price curves described above to an
internally developed forward price which was based on the average O&M charges from the three surrogate nuclear power plants for
the current year. The Company estimated the volumes of the transactions that would take place in the future based on historical
average transaction volumes per delivery year (November to April). Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in
isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
For the natural gas commodity exchange agreement, the Company uses the same Level 2 brokered quotes described above; however,
the Company also estimates the purchase and sales volumes (within contractual limits) as well as the timing of those transactions.
Changing the timing of volume estimates changes the timing of purchases and sales, impacting which brokered quote is used. Because
the brokered quotes can vary significantly from period to period, the unobservable estimates of the timing and volume of transactions
can have a significant impact on the calculated fair value. The Company currently estimates volumes and timing of transactions based
on a most likely scenario using historical data. Historically, the timing and volume of transactions have not been highly correlated
with market prices and market volatility.
The following table presents the quantitative information which was used to estimate the fair values of the Level 3 assets and
liabilities above as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):

The valuation methods, significant inputs and resulting fair values described above were developed by the Company's management
and are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis to ensure they provide a reasonable estimate of fair value each reporting period.

NOTE 15. COMMON STOCK
The payment of dividends on common stock could be limited by:
                    certain covenants applicable to preferred stock (when outstanding) contained in the Company’s Restated Articles of
                     Incorporation, as amended (currently there are no preferred shares outstanding),
                    certain covenants applicable to the Company's outstanding long-term debt and committed line of credit agreements,
                    the hydroelectric licensing requirements of section 10(d) of the FPA (see Note 1), and
                    certain requirements under the OPUC approval of the AERC acquisition in 2014. The OPUC's AERC acquisition
                     order requires Avista Corp. to maintain a capital structure of no less than 35 percent common equity (inclusive of
                     short-term debt). This limitation may be revised upon request by the Company with approval from the OPUC.
The requirements of the OPUC approval of the AERC acquisition are the most restrictive. Under the OPUC restriction, the amount
available for dividends at December 31, 2019 was limited to $293.9 million.
The Company has 10 million authorized shares of preferred stock. The Company did not have any preferred stock outstanding as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Equity Issuances
The Company issued equity in 2019 for total net proceeds of $64.6 million. Most of these issuances came through the Company's four
separate sales agency agreements under which the sales agents may offer and sell new shares of common stock from time to time.
These agreements provide for the offering of a maximum of 4.6 million shares, of which approximately 3.2 million remain unissued
as of December 31, 2019. In 2019, 1.4 million shares were issued under these agreements resulting in total net proceeds of $63.6
million. Subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions (including any required regulatory approvals), the Company has the right
to increase the maximum number of shares that may be offered under these agreements. These agreements expire on February 29,
2020. The Company expects to negotiate and enter into new sales agency agreements in the second quarter of 2020.
NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In the course of its business, the Company becomes involved in various claims, controversies, disputes and other contingent matters,
including the items described in this Note. Some of these claims, controversies, disputes and other contingent matters involve
litigation or other contested proceedings. For all such matters, the Company intends to vigorously protect and defend its interests and
pursue its rights. However, no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of any particular matter because litigation and other
contested proceedings are inherently subject to numerous uncertainties. For matters that affect Avista Corp.’s operations, the
Company intends to seek, to the extent appropriate, recovery of incurred costs through the ratemaking process.
Collective Bargaining Agreements
The Company’s collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW represent approximately 45 percent of all of Avista Corp.’
employees. A three-year agreement with the local union in Washington and Idaho representing the majority (approximately 90
percent) of the Avista Corp.' bargaining unit employees will expire in March 2021. A three-year agreement in Oregon, which covers
approximately 50 employees will also expire on April 1, 2020.
The Company is in the process of negotiating new agreements with each of these represented bargaining units. However, there is a
risk that if collective bargaining agreements expire and new agreements are not reached in each of our jurisdictions, employees could

operations. However, the Company believes that the possibility of this occurring is remote.
Legal Proceedings Related to the Terminated Acquisition by Hydro One
See Note 18 for information regarding the termination of the proposed acquisition of the Company by Hydro One.
In connection with the now terminated acquisition, three lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Washington and were subsequently voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.
One lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court for the State of Washington in and for Spokane County, captioned as follows:
           Fink v. Morris, et al., No. 17203616-6 (filed September 15, 2017, amended complaint filed October 25, 2017).
The complaint generally alleged that the members of the Board of Directors of Avista Corp. breached their fiduciary duties by, among
other things, conducting an allegedly inadequate sale process and agreeing to the acquisition at a price that allegedly undervalued
Avista Corporation, and that Hydro One Limited, Olympus Holding Corp., and Olympus Corp. aided and abetted those purported
breaches of duty. The complaint sought various remedies, including monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and expenses. Subsequent to
the termination of the proposed acquisition in January 2019, the complaint was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.
Boyds Fire (State of Washington Department of Natural Resources v. Avista)
On August 19, 2019, the Company was served with a complaint filed by the State of Washington Department of Natural Resources,
seeking recovery of fire suppression costs and related expenses incurred in connection with a wildfire that occurred in Ferry County,
Washington in August 2018. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the fire, which became known as the “Boyds Fire,” was caused
by a dead ponderosa pine tree falling into an overhead distribution line, and that Avista Corp. was negligent in failing to identify and
remove it before the tree came into contact with the line. Avista Corp. disputes that the tree in question was the cause of the fire, and
that it was negligent in failing to identify and remove it. The case is in the early stages of discovery and the plaintiff has not yet
provided a statement specifying damages. Because the resolution of this claim remains uncertain, legal counsel cannot express an
opinion on the extent, if any, of the Company’s liability, nor is it possible for the Company to estimate the impact of any outcome at
this time. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation.
Other Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company has various other legal claims and contingent matters outstanding. The Company
believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. It is possible that a change could occur in the Company’s estimates of the probability or amount of a liability
being incurred. Such a change, should it occur, could be significant.
The Company routinely assesses, based on studies, expert analysis and legal reviews, its contingencies, obligations and commitments
for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties
who either have or have not agreed to a settlement as well as recoveries from insurance carriers. The Company’s policy is to accrue
and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on estimates of investigation,
cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. For matters that affect Avista Corp.’ operations, the Company seeks, to the extent
appropriate, recovery of incurred costs through the ratemaking process.
The Company has potential liabilities under the Endangered Species Act for species of fish, plants and wildlife that have either
already been added to the endangered species list, listed as “threatened” or petitioned for listing. Thus far, measures adopted and
implemented have had minimal impact on the Company. However, the Company will continue to seek recovery, through the
ratemaking process, of all operating and capitalized costs related to these issues.
Under the federal licenses for its hydroelectric projects, the Company is obligated to protect its property rights, including water rights.

In addition, the Company holds additional non-hydro water rights. The State of Montana is examining the status of all water right
claims within state boundaries through a general adjudication. Claims within the Clark Fork River basin could adversely affect the
energy production of the Company’s Cabinet Gorge and Noxon Rapids hydroelectric facilities. The state of Idaho has initiated
adjudication in northern Idaho, which will ultimately include the lower Clark Fork River, the Spokane River and the Coeur d’Alene
basin. The Company is and will continue to be a participant in these and any other relevant adjudication processes. The complexity of
such adjudications makes each unlikely to be concluded in the foreseeable future. As such, it is not possible for the Company to
estimate the impact of any outcome at this time. The Company will continue to seek recovery, through the ratemaking process, of all
operating and capitalized costs related to this issue.
NOTE 17. REGULATORY MATTERS
Power Cost Deferrals and Recovery Mechanisms
Deferred power supply costs are recorded as a deferred charge or liability on the Balance Sheets for future prudence review and
recovery or rebate through retail rates. The power supply costs deferred include certain differences between actual net power supply
costs incurred by Avista Corp. and the costs included in base retail rates. This difference in net power supply costs primarily results
from changes in:
                   short-term wholesale market prices and sales and purchase volumes,
                   the level, availability and optimization of hydroelectric generation,
                   the level and availability of thermal generation (including changes in fuel prices),
                   retail loads, and
                   sales of surplus transmission capacity.
In Washington, the ERM allows Avista Corp. to periodically increase or decrease electric rates with WUTC approval to reflect
changes in power supply costs. The ERM is an accounting method used to track certain differences between actual power supply
costs, net of wholesale sales and sales of fuel, and the amount included in base retail rates for Washington customers and defer these
differences (over the $4.0 million deadband and sharing bands) for future surcharge or rebate to customers. For 2019, the Company
recognized a pre-tax benefit of $4.4 million under the ERM in Washington compared to a benefit of $6.1 million for 2018. Total net
deferred power costs under the ERM were a liability of $40.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and a liability of $34.4 million as of
December 31, 2018. These deferred power cost balances represent amounts due to customers. Pursuant to WUTC requirements,
should the cumulative deferral balance exceed $30 million in the rebate or surcharge direction, the Company must make a filing with
the WUTC to adjust customer rates to either return the balance to customers or recover the balance from customers. Avista Corp.
makes an annual filing on, or before, April 1 of each year to provide the opportunity for the WUTC staff and other interested parties
to review the prudence of, and audit, the ERM deferred power cost transactions for the prior calendar year.
The cumulative rebate balance exceeds $30 million and as a result, the Company's 2019 filing contained a proposed rate refund,
effective July 1, 2019 over a three-year period. Subsequent to this filing, the WUTC approved the ERM rebate over a two-year
period.
Avista Corp. has a PCA mechanism in Idaho that allows it to modify electric rates on October 1 of each year with IPUC approval.
Under the PCA mechanism, Avista Corp. defers 90 percent of the difference between certain actual net power supply expenses and
the amount included in base retail rates for its Idaho customers. The October 1 rate adjustments recover or rebate power costs deferred
during the preceding July-June twelve-month period. Total net power supply costs deferred under the PCA mechanism were an asset
of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and a liability of $7.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Deferred power cost assets represent

amounts due from customers and liabilities represent amounts due to customers.
Natural Gas Cost Deferrals and Recovery Mechanisms
Avista Corp. files a PGA in all three states it serves to adjust natural gas rates for: 1) estimated commodity and pipeline transportation
costs to serve natural gas customers for the coming year, and 2) the difference between actual and estimated commodity and
transportation costs for the prior year. Total net deferred natural gas costs to be refunded to customers were a liability of $3.2 million
as of December 31, 2019 and a liability of $40.7 million as of December 31, 2018. These balances represent amounts due to
customers.
Decoupling and Earnings Sharing Mechanisms
Decoupling (also known as an FCA in Idaho) is a mechanism designed to sever the link between a utility's revenues and consumers'
energy usage. In each of Avista Corp.' jurisdictions, Avista Corp.' electric and natural gas revenues are adjusted so as to be based on
the number of customers in certain customer rate classes and assumed "normal" kilowatt hour and therm sales, rather than being based
on actual kilowatt hour and therm sales. The difference between revenues based on the number of customers and "normal" sales and
revenues based on actual usage is deferred and either surcharged or rebated to customers beginning in the following year. Only
residential and certain commercial customer classes are included in decoupling mechanisms.
Washington Decoupling and Earnings Sharing
In Washington, the WUTC approved the Company's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas for a five-year period
beginning January 1, 2015. In March 2020, th WUTC extended the electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms through March
31, 2025. Electric and natural gas decoupling surcharge rate adjustments to customers are limited to a 3 percent increase on an annual
basis, with any remaining surcharge balance carried forward for recovery in a future period. There is no limit on the level of rebate
rate adjustments.
The decoupling mechanisms each include an after-the-fact earnings test. At the end of each calendar year, separate electric and natural
gas earnings calculations are made for the calendar year just ended. These earnings tests reflect actual decoupled revenues,
normalized power supply costs and other normalizing adjustments. If the Company earns more than its authorized ROR in
Washington, 50 percent of excess earnings are rebated to customers through adjustments to decoupling surcharge or rebate balances.
See below for a summary of cumulative balances under the decoupling and earnings sharing mechanisms.
Idaho FCA and Earnings Sharing Mechanisms
In Idaho, the IPUC approved the implementation of FCAs for electric and natural gas (similar in operation and effect to the
Washington decoupling mechanisms) for an initial term of three years, beginning January 1, 2016. During the first quarter of 2018,
the FCA in Idaho was extended for a one-year term through December 31, 2019. On December 13, 2019, the IPUC approved an
extension of the FCAs through March 31, 2025.
Oregon Decoupling Mechanism
In February 2016, the OPUC approved the implementation of a decoupling mechanism for natural gas, similar to the Washington and
Idaho mechanisms described above. The decoupling mechanism became effective on March 1, 2016. There will be an opportunity for
interested parties to review the mechanism and recommend changes, if any, by September 2019. Changes related to deferral interest
rates were recommended by the parties in Avista Corp.'s 2019 general rate case and were implemented effective January 15, 2020. In
Oregon, an earnings review is conducted on an annual basis. In the annual earnings review, if the Company earns more than 100 basis
points above its allowed ROE, one-third of the earnings above the 100 basis points would be deferred and later returned to customers.
The earnings review is separate from the decoupling mechanism and was in place prior to decoupling. See below for a summary of
cumulative balances under the decoupling and earnings sharing mechanisms.

NOTE 18. TERMINATION OF PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY HYDRO ONE
On July 19, 2017, Avista Corp. entered into a Merger Agreement that provided for Avista Corp. to become an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Hydro One, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including approval by regulatory
agencies. Hydro One, based in Toronto, is Ontario’s largest electricity transmission and distribution provider.
Termination of the Merger Agreement
Due to the denial of the proposed merger by certain of the Company's regulatory commissions, on January 23, 2019, Avista Corp.,
Hydro One and certain subsidiaries thereof, entered into a Termination Agreement indicating their mutual agreement to terminate the
Merger Agreement, effective immediately. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, Hydro One paid Avista Corp. a $103
million termination fee on January 24, 2019. The termination fee was used for reimbursing the Company's transaction costs incurred
from 2017 to 2019. The balance of the termination fee remaining after payment of 2019 transaction costs and applicable income taxes
was used for general corporate purposes and reduced the Company's need for external financing. The 2019 costs totaled $19.7 million
pre-tax and included financial advisers' fees, legal fees, consulting fees and employee time.
Other Information Related to the Terminated Acquisition
Due to the termination of the acquisition, all the financial commitments that were included in the various settlement agreements with
the commissions for the proposed acquisition will not be required to be performed or observed.
The Company incurred significant transaction costs consisting primarily of consulting, banking fees, legal fees and employee time,
and these costs are not being passed through to customers. When the Company was assuming the transaction was going to be
completed, a significant portion of these costs were not deductible for income tax purposes. Now that the transaction has been
terminated, more of the previously incurred transaction costs are deductible so it has recorded additional tax benefits from these costs
in 2019.
See Note 16 for discussion of shareholder lawsuits filed against the Company, the Company’s directors, Hydro One, Olympus
Holding Corp., and Olympus Corp. in relation to the Merger Agreement and the proposed acquisition.

NOTE 19. SALE OF METALfx
In April 2019, Bay Area Manufacturing, Inc., a non-regulated subsidiary of Avista Corp., entered into a definitive agreement to sell
its interest in METALfx to an independent third party. The transaction was a stock sale for a total cash purchase price of $17.5
million, plus cash on-hand, subject to customary closing adjustments. The transaction closed on April 18, 2019, and as of that date the
Company has no further involvement with METALfx.
The purchase price of $17.5 million, as adjusted, was divided among the security holders of METALfx, including the minority
shareholder, pro-rata based on ownership (Avista Corp. owned 89.2 percent of the equity of METALfx). As required under the
purchase agreement, $1.2 million (7 percent of the purchase price) will be held in escrow for 24 months from the closing of the
transaction to satisfy certain indemnification obligations.
When all escrow amounts are released, the sales transaction is expected to provide cash proceeds to Avista Corp., net of payments to
the minority holder, contractually obligated compensation payments and other transaction expenses, of $16.5 million and result in a
net gain after-tax of $3.3 million. The Company expects to receive the full amount of its portion of the escrow accounts; therefore, the
full amounts are included in the gain calculation.

NOTE 21. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company as evaluated its subsequent events as of April 14th, 2020.
2015 Washington General Rate Cases
In January 2016, the Company received an order (Order 05) that concluded its electric and natural gas general rate cases that were
originally filed with the WUTC in February 2015. New electric and natural gas rates were effective on January 11, 2016.
PC Petition for Judicial Review
In March 2016, PC filed in Thurston County Superior Court a Petition for Judicial Review of the WUTC's Order 05 described above.
In April 2016, this matter was certified for review directly by the Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court in the State of
Washington.
On August 7, 2018, the Court of Appeals issued a "Published Opinion" (Opinion) which concluded that the WUTC's use of an
attrition allowance to calculate Avista Corp.'s rate base violated Washington law. In the Opinion, the Court stated that because the
projected additions to rate base in the future were not "used and useful" for service at the time the request for the rate increase was
made, they may not lawfully be included in the Company's rate base to justify a rate increase. Accordingly, the Court concluded that
the WUTC erred in including an attrition allowance in the calculation of Avista Corp.’s electric and natural gas rate base. The Court
noted, however, that the law does not prohibit an attrition allowance in the calculation, for ratemaking purposes, of recoverable
operating and maintenance expense. Since the WUTC order provided one lump sum attrition allowance without distinguishing what

portion was for rate base and which was for operating and maintenance expenses or other considerations, the Court struck all portions
of the attrition allowance attributable to Avista Corp.'s rate base and reversed and remanded the case for the WUTC to recalculate
Avista Corp.’s rates without including an attrition allowance in the calculation of rate base.
On March 6, 2020, the Company received an order from the WUTC that will require it to refund $8.5 million to electric and natural
gas customers. The Company will refund $4.9 million to electric customers and $3.6 million to natural gas customers. The Company
recorded a customer refund liability of $8.5 million in 2019.
Colstrip Units 3 & 4 Outage and Replacement Power Costs
In 2019, the Company filed a case with the WUTC to recover costs associated with an unplanned power outage at Colstrip Units 3
and 4. The primary issue is related to the cost of replacement power incurred in July and August 2018 due to a forced outage at
Colstrip Units 3 & 4. That outage occurred due to the plant exceeding certain air quality standards. In testimony filed by WUTC Staff
and Public Counsel on January 10, 2020, the parties recommend the WUTC disallow $3.3 million in replacement power costs. Avista
Corp. filed testimony on January 23, 2020, and provided support for no disallowance, but if the WUTC believes a disallowance is
appropriate, the level of disallowance would be $2.4 million.
On March 20, 2020, the Company received an order from the WUTC related to costs associated with a an unplanned outage of
Colstrip Units 3 and 4 in 2018. In its order, the WUTC disallowed approximately $3 million for the cost of replacement power during
the unplanned outage.
2019 Washington General Rate Cases
On March 25, 2020, the Company received an order from the WUTC that approved the partial multi-party settlement agreement that
was filed on November 21, 2019. The approved rates are designed to increase annual base electric revenues by $28.5 million, or 5.7
percent, and annual natural gas base revenues by $8.0 million, or 8.5 percent, effective April 1, 2020. The revenue increases are based
on a 9.4 percent return on equity with a common equity ratio of 48.5 percent and a rate of return on rate base of 7.21 percent.
As part of the WUTC order, the Company will return approximately $40 million from the ERM rebate to customers over a two-year
period. The ERM rebate includes approximately $3 million that was recently disallowed by the Commission for the cost of
replacement power during an unplanned outage at the Colstrip generating facility in 2018. The Commission directed the Company to
return a larger portion of the ERM money during the first year to achieve a net-zero billed impact to electric customers.
Included in the WUTC order is the acceleration of depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 & 4, to reflect a remaining useful life through
December 31, 2025. The order utilizes certain electric tax benefits associated with the 2018 tax reform to partially offset these
increased costs. The order also sets aside $3 million for community transition efforts to mitigate the impacts of the eventual closure of
Colstrip, half funded by customers and half funded by Company shareholders.
In addition, a recent order received from the WUTC on the 2015 remand cases requires the Company to refund $8.5 million to electric
and natural gas customers. The Company will refund $4.9 million to electric customers and $3.6 million to natural gas customers over
a one year period, which will partially offset the increase in base rates.
Lastly, the order includes the extension of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms through March 31, 2025.

On April 6, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank National Association, as Lender and Administrative
Agent, and CoBank, ACB, as Lender in the amount of $100 million with a maturity date of April 5, 2021. Loans under this agreement
are unsecured and will have a variable annual interest rate determined by either the Eurodollar rate or the Alternative Base Rate
depending on the type of loan selected by Avista Corp.
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions, including a covenant not to permit the ratio of
"consolidated total debt" to "consolidated total capitalization" of Avista Corp. to be greater than 65 percent at any time.
The Company has borrowed the entire $100 million available under this agreement, which is expected to be used to provide additional
liquidity and for general corporate purposes.

                                                  General Description of Construction Overhead Procedure
   1. For each construction overhead explain: (a) the nature and extent of work, etc., the overhead charges are intended to cover, (b) the general
 procedure for determining the amount capitalized, (c) the method of distribution to construction jobs, (d) whether different rates are applied to
 different types of construction, (e) basis of differentiation in rates for different types of construction, and (f) whether the overhead is directly or
 indirectly assigned.
   2. Show below the computation of allowance for funds used during construction rates, in accordance with the provisions of Gas Plant
 Instructions 3 (17) of the Uniform System of Accounts.
   3. Where a net-of-tax rate for borrowed funds is used, show the appropriate tax effect adjustment to the computations below in a manner that
 clearly indicates the amount of reduction in the gross rate for tax effects.
 Construction costs with a direct relationship to new construction and capital replacement activities that cannot be clearly
identified with specific projects are charged to overhead pools. The established pools are:
      Construction Overhead North Gas
      Construction Overhead South Gas
Pool costs are allocated monthly to gas construction projects on a percent rate applied to direct project costs, excluding
AFUDC. Each pool's rate is calculated separately and applied only to the related gas construction projects for allocation.

  1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
  2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 10, column (c), and that reported for gas
plant in service, page 204-209, column (d), excluding retirements of nondepreciable property.
  3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when
such plant is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded
and/or classified to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book
cost of the plant retired. In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional
classifications.
  4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.
  5. At lines 7 and 14, add rows as necessary to report all data. Additional rows should be numbered in sequence, e.g., 7.01, 7.02, etc.

                                    Securities Issued or Assumed and Securities Refunded or Retired During the Year
   1. Furnish a supplemental statement briefly describing security financing and refinancing transactions during the year and the accounting for the
 securities, discounts, premiums, expenses, and related gains or losses. Identify as to Commission authorization numbers and dates.
   2. Provide details showing the full accounting for the total principal amount, par value, or stated value of each class and series of security
 issued, assumed, retired, or refunded and the accounting for premiums, discounts, expenses, and gains or losses relating to the securities. Set
 forth the facts of the accounting clearly with regard to redemption premiums, unamortized discounts, expenses, and gain or losses relating to
 securities retired or refunded, including the accounting for such amounts carried in the respondent's accounts at the date of the refunding or
 refinancing transactions with respect to securities previously refunded or retired.
   3. Include in the identification of each class and series of security, as appropriate, the interest or dividend rate, nominal date of issuance,
 maturity date, aggregate principal amount, par value or stated value, and number of shares. Give also the issuance of redemption price and
 name of the principal underwriting firm through which the security transactions were consummated.
   4. Where the accounting for amounts relating to securities refunded or retired is other than that specified in General Instruction 17 of the Uniform
 System of Accounts, cite the Commission authorization for the different accounting and state the accounting method.
   5. For securities assumed, give the name of the company for which the liability on the securities was assumed as well as details of the
 transactions whereby the respondent undertook to pay obligations of another company. If any unamortized discount, premiums, expenses, and
 gains or losses were taken over onto the respondent's books, furnish details of these amounts with amounts relating to refunded securities clearly
 earmarked.
 In November 2019, the Company issued and sold $180.0 million of 3.43 percent first mortgage bonds due in
2049 pursuant to a bond purchase agreement with institutional investors in the private placement market. The
total net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay maturing long-term debt of $90.0 million, repay
a portion of the outstanding balance under Avista Corp.'s $400.0 million committed line of credit and for other
general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance and sale of the first mortgage bonds, the Company
cash settled six interest rate swap derivatives (notional aggregate amount of $70.0 million) and paid a net
amount of $13.3 million. See note 7 for a discussion of interest rate swap derivatives.
The new issuance is based on the following state commission orders:
1. Order of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission in Docket No. 171210 entered
      January 11, 2018;
2. Order of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, Order No. 33978 entered January 30, 2018;
3. Order of the Public Utility Commission of Oregon, Order No. 19-249, entered July 30, 2019;
Order of the Public Service Commission of the State of Montana, Default Order No. 4535
We issued equity in 2019 for total net proceeds of $64.6 million. Most of these issuances came through our four separate sales agency
agreements under which the sales agents may offer and sell new shares of our common stock from time to time. These agreements
provide for the offering of a maximum of 4.6 million shares, of which approximately 3.2 million remain unissued as of December 31,
2019. In 2019, 1.4 million shares were issued under these agreements resulting in total net proceeds of $63.6 million. Subject to the
satisfaction of customary conditions (including any required regulatory approvals), we have the right to increase the maximum
number of shares that may be offered under these agreements. These agreements expire on February 29, 2020. We expect to negotiate
and enter into new sales agency agreements in the second quarter of 2020.

                                  Reconciliation of Reported Net Income with Taxable Income for Feder Income Taxes
  1. Report the reconciliation of reported net income for the year with taxable income used in computing Federal Income Tax accruals
and show computation of such tax accruals. Include in the reconciliation, as far as practicable, the same detail as furnished on Schedule
M-1 of the tax return for the year. Submit a reconciliation even though there is no taxable income for the year. Indicate clearly the
nature of each reconciling amount.
  2. If the utility is a member of a group that files consolidated Federal tax return, reconcile reported net income with taxable net income
as if a separate return were to be filed, indicating, however, intercompany amounts to be eliminated in such a consolidated return. State
names of group members, tax assigned to each group member, and basis of allocation, assignments, or sharing of the consolidated tax
among the group members.

 Report below the distribution of total salaries and wages for the year. Segregate amounts originally charged to clearing accounts to Utility Departments, Construction, Plant Removals and
Other Accounts, and enter such amounts in the appropriate lines and columns provided. Salaries and wages billed to the Respondent by an affiliated company must be assigned to the
particular operating function(s) relating to the expenses.
 In determining this segregation of salaries and wages originally charged to clearing accounts, a method of approximation giving substantially correct results may be used. When reporting
detail of other accounts, enter as many rows as necessary numbered sequentially starting with 75.01, 75.02, etc.
