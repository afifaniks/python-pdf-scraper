FERC FORM No.1/3-Q (REV. 02-04)
                                    Report of Independent Auditors
To the Board of Directors and
Management of Puget Sound Energy, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Puget Sound Energy, Inc, which comprise the
balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related statements of income, of retained
earnings, and of cash flows for the years then ended, included on pages 110.0 through 123.42 of the
accompanying Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Form No.1.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as set forth in
its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases described in Note 1. on page
123.1. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with the accounting requirements of
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and
published accounting releases described in Note 1.

Basis of Accounting
We draw attention to Note 1 of the financial statements, which describes the basis of accounting. As
described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the financial statements are prepared by Puget Sound
Energy, Inc. on the basis of the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as
set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases, which is a basis
of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, to meet
the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Our opinion is not modified with respect
to this matter.
Restriction of Use
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Directors and Management of
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is not intended to be and
should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
Emphasis of Matter
As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for leases in 2019. Our opinion is not modified in respect to this manner.

Definitions
1. See the Uniform System of Accounts for a definition of control.
2. Direct control is that which is exercised without interposition of an intermediary.
3. Indirect control is that which is exercised by the interposition of an intermediary which exercises direct control.
4. Joint control is that in which neither interest can effectively control or direct action without the consent of the other, as where the
voting control is equally divided between two holders, or each party holds a veto power over the other. Joint control may exist by mutual
agreement or understanding between two or more parties who together have control within the meaning of the definition of control in the
Uniform System of Accounts, regardless of the relative voting rights of each party.

Credit Facilities
As of December 31, 2019, no amounts were drawn and outstanding under PSE's credit facility. No letters of credit were outstanding
and $176.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program. Outside of the credit agreement, PSE had a $2.8 million
letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in
Canada.
Long Term Debt
On August 2, 2019, PSE filed a new shelf registration statement under which it may issue, up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal
amount of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds. As of the date of this report, $550.0 million was available under the
registration. The shelf registration will expire in August 2022.
Substantially all utility properties owned by PSE are subject to the lien of the Company’s electric and natural gas mortgage
indentures. To issue additional first mortgage bonds under these indentures, PSE’s earnings available for interest must exceed certain
minimums as defined in the indentures. At December 31, 2019, the earnings available for interest exceeded the required amount.
On August 30, 2019, PSE issued $450.0 million of senior notes at an interest rate of 3.250%. (Filing UE-190700) The notes pay
interest semi-annually and are due to mature on September 15, 2049. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay
outstanding short term debt under the Company’s commercial paper program.

                                      IMPORTANT CHANGES DURING THE QUARTER/YEAR (Continued)
General Rate Case Filing
      PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas
rates of 6.9% and 7.9% respectively. PSE requested a return on equity of 9.8% with an overall rate of return of 7.62%. In addition to
the traditional areas of focus (revenue requirements, cost allocation, rate design and cost of capital), the Company completed an
attrition study and included a portion of the attrition revenue requirement in the overall request in order address the expected
regulatory lag in the rate year. Additionally, as the non-plant related excess deferred taxes that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) remained outstanding from PSE’s Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) as discussed below, PSE requested in its GRC to pass back the
amounts over four years. On September 17, 2019, PSE filed a supplemental filing in the GRC, which provided updates as discussed in
our original filing, but did not impact the requested overall electric and natural gas rate increases, return on equity or overall rate of
return as originally filed. On January 15, 2020, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested return on
equity to 9.5%, which decreased the rate of return to 7.48%. The requested rate increase for both electric and natural gas remained at
6.9% and 7.9%, respectively. For both electric and natural gas PSE did not originally request its full attrition adjustment; therefore, the
decrease in return on equity led to a reduction in the electric rate increase of only $1.5 million and did not have an impact on the
natural gas rate increase.
Expedited Rate Filing Rate Adjustment
      On November 7, 2018, PSE filed an expedited rate filing (ERF) with the Washington Commission. The filing requested to change
rates associated with PSE’s delivery and fixed production costs. It did not include variable power costs, purchased gas costs or natural
gas pipeline replacement program costs, which are recovered in separate mechanisms. The filing was based on historical test year
costs and rate base, and followed the reporting requirements of a Commission Basis Report, as defined by the Washington
Administrative Code, but used end of period rate base and certain annualizing adjustments. It did not include any forward-looking or
pro-forma adjustments. Included in the filing was a reduction to the overall authorized rate of return from 7.6% to 7.49% to recognize
a reduction in debt costs associated with recent debt activity. PSE requested an overall increase in electric rates of $18.9 million
annually, which is a 0.9% increase, and an overall increase in natural gas rates of $21.7 million annually, which is a 2.7% increase.
      On January 22, 2019, all parties in the proceeding reached an agreement on settlement terms that resolved all issues in the filing.
The settlement agreement was filed on January 30, 2019. The parties agreed to a $21.5 million for natural gas and no rate increase for
electric which became effective March 1, 2019. As is discussed below, these rates include the offsetting effect of passing back to
customers plant related excess deferred income taxes that resulted from the TCJA, using the average rate assumption method (ARAM)
amounts to arrive at the settlement rate changes.
      The settlement agreement provides for the pass back of plant related excess deferred income taxes that resulted from the TCJA
using the ARAM methodology based on 2018 amounts beginning March 1, 2019, in the amount of $6.1 million for natural gas
customers and $25.9 million for electric customers. The settlement agreement left the determination for the regulatory treatment of the
remaining items related to the TCJA, listed below, to PSE’s next GRC, filed June 20, 2019:
       1) excess deferred taxes for non-plant-related book/tax differences for periods prior to March 1, 2019,
       2) the deferred balance associated with the over-collection of income tax expense for the period January 1 through April 30,
           2018 (the time period that encompasses the effective date of the TCJA to May 1, 2018, the effective date of the TCJA rate
           change); and
       3) the turnaround of plant related excess deferred income taxes using the ARAM method for the period from January 2018
           through February 2019, the rate effective date for the ERF.
      The agreement provides that PSE may defer the depreciation expense associated with PSE’s ongoing investment in its advanced
metering infrastructure (AMI) investment and may defer the return on the AMI investment that was included in the test year of the
filing. The agreement preserves the parties' rights to argue whether or not these deferrals should be recovered in the Company’s 2019
GRC. The rate of return adopted in the settlement for reporting and deferral purposes is 7.49% . On February 21, 2019, the
Washington Commission approved the settlement with one condition: PSE must pass back the deferred balance associated with the tax
over-collection of $34.6 million for the period from January 1, 2018, through April 30, 2018, over a one-year period which began May
1, 2019.
Washington Commission Tax Deferral Filing
      The TCJA was signed into law in December 2017. As a result of this change, PSE re-measured its deferred tax balances under the
new corporate tax rate. PSE filed an accounting petition on December 29, 2017, requesting deferred accounting treatment for the

impacts of tax reform. The requested deferral accounting treatment resulted in the tax rate change being captured in the deferred
income tax balance with an offset to the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes for GAAP purposes. Additionally, on March 30,
2018, PSE filed for a rate change for electric and natural gas customers associated with TCJA to reflect the decrease in the federal
corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. The overall impact of the rate change, based on the annual period from May 2018
through April 2019, is a revenue decrease of $72.9 million, or 3.4%, for electric and $23.6 million, or 2.7%, for natural gas and
became effective May 1, 2018, by operation of law.
     The March 30, 2018, rate change filing did not address excess deferred taxes or the deferred balance associated with the
over-collection of income tax expense of $34.6 million for the period January 1 through April 30, 2018 (the time period that
encompasses the effective date of the TCJA through May 1, 2018, the effective date of the rate change). The $34.6 million tax
over-collection decreased PSE's revenue and increased the regulatory liability for a refund to customers.
     As a result of the Washington Commission's final order in the ERF, the excess deferred taxes associated with non-plant-related
book/tax differences and the treatment of the excess deferred taxes associated with plant related book/tax differences from January 1,
2019, through February 28, 2019, was addressed in PSE’s GRC, which was filed on June 20, 2019. The Washington Commission also
required in the ERF order that PSE pass back the deferred balance associated with the tax over-collection for the period from January
1, 2018, through April 30, 2018, as discussed above, over a one-year period which began May 1, 2019.
Decoupling Filings
     While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to
month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Since July
2013, the Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues
related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from most residential,
commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns
per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual
consumption levels. PSE's energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling
mechanism. The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
 Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and
the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period.
     On December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE’s request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling
mechanism with several changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017. Electric and natural gas delivery
revenues continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs are now decoupled and recovered
on the basis of a fixed monthly amount. The allowed decoupling revenue for electric and natural gas customers will no longer increase
annually each January 1 as occurred prior to December 19, 2017. Approved revenue per customer costs can only be changed in a GRC
or ERF. Approved electric fixed production energy costs can also be changed in a power cost only rate case (PCORC). Other changes
to the decoupling methodology approved by the Washington Commission include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential
customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward. The rate test, which limits
the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings, increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at
3.0% for electric customers. The decoupling mechanism will be reviewed again in PSE’s first rate case filed in or after 2021, or in a
separate proceeding, if appropriate. PSE’s decoupling mechanism over- and under- collections will still be collectible or refundable
after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
     On February 21, 2019, the Washington Commission approved the multi-party settlement agreement which was filed within PSE’s
ERF filing. As part of this settlement agreement, electric and natural gas allowed delivery revenue per customer was updated to reflect
changes in the approved revenue requirement. For electric, there were no changes to the annual allowed fixed power cost revenue. The
changes took effect on March 1, 2019.
     On December 31, 2019, PSE performed an analysis to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be
collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980. If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE would need to
record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and regulatory asset balance. Once the reserve is probable of collection within 24
months from the end of the annual period, the reserve can be recognized as decoupling revenue. The analysis indicated that electric
and natural gas deferred revenue will be collected within 24 months of the annual period; therefore, no adjustment was booked to 2019
decoupling revenue. The previously unrecognized decoupling deferrals of $0.8 million and $20.8 million at December 31, 2018, and
December 31, 2016, were recognized as decoupling revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2017,
respectively.

Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism
     PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the “power cost baseline” level of
power costs. The “power cost baseline” levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric
conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in
the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
      Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism:
                                                                          Company’s Share                   Customers' Share

 Over or Under Collected by up to $17 million                           100 %            100 %              — %              — %
 Over or Under Collected by between $17 million - $40 million            35               50                65               50
 Over or Under Collected beyond $40 + million                            10               10                90               90
     In September 2016, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission which requested deferral of the variances,
either positive or negative, between the fixed costs previously recovered in the PCA and the revenue received to cover the allowed
fixed costs. The deferral period requested was January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, when rates were to go into effect from
PSE's 2017 GRC. In November 2016, the Washington Commission issued Order No. 01 approving PSE’s accounting petition. With
the final determination in PSE’s GRC, this deferral ceased with the rate effective date of December 19, 2017.
     For the year ended December 31, 2019, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its allowable costs by $67.2 million of which
$36.0 million was apportioned to customers and $1.0 million of interest was accrued on the deferred customer balance. This compares
to an under recovery of allowable costs of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which no amounts were apportioned
to customers and accrued $0.2 million of interest on the total deferred customer balance. Power costs have been higher than the
allowed base line in 2019 which has led to an increase in the PCA deferral causing a higher under-collection compared to the prior
year. Actual power costs were higher than baseline rates in 2018 also but by a narrower margin, resulting in lower under-collection.
Power prices increased during 2019 as compared to the prior year due to: (i) Cold weather in February and early March, which drove
regional loads and demand for power up; (ii) Westcoast pipeline capacity limitations, which contributed to higher natural gas and
power prices; (iii) An outage on a transmission line, which contributed to a liquidity crisis at Mid-C and resulted in high market power
prices; and (iv) The relative prices of natural gas and power, which reduced the supply of natural gas-fired generation and increased the
demand for market power, increasing prices.
Purchased Gas Adjustment
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, PSE had a beginning PGA payable balance of $16.1 million, incurred actual natural gas
costs of $319.3 million, of which $292.0 million was recovered through rates. The difference between actual and allowed costs, less
interest $1.3 million, resulted in a PGA receivable of $9.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PSE had incurred actual
natural gas costs of $406.2 million, of which $289.9 million was recovered through rates. The difference between actual and allowed
costs, plus interest of $6.6 million, resulted in a PGA receivable of $132.8 million.
     On April 25, 2019, the Washington Commission approved PSE’s request for an out-of-cycle change to PGA rates with the rate
change taking effect May 1, 2019. The out-of-cycle PGA filing was needed to begin amortizing a large PGA commodity deferral
balance that had grown due to higher than projected commodity costs during the 2018/19 winter. These higher than projected
commodity costs were primarily due to an October 9, 2018, rupture and subsequent explosion on Westcoast Pipeline which is one of
the major pipelines feeding PSE’s distribution system. The pipeline was repaired in October 2018, however supply capacity on the
pipeline was limited over the 2018/19 winter leading to higher prices. February weather was also much colder than normal which also
increased the demand for natural gas. The amortization period will be from May 2019 through April 2020.
     On October 24, 2019, the Washington Commission approved PSE’s request for November 2019 PGA rates, with the rate change
taking effect on November 1, 2019. As part of that filing, PSE requested PGA rates increase annual revenue by $17.8 million, while
the new tracker rates increased by annual revenue of $100.6 million; this was in addition to continuing the collection on the remaining
balance of $54.0 million from the out-of-cycle PGA. The tracker rates include deferral balances for the three separate amounts: (i)
$114.4 million of under collected commodity balances deferred in February and March; (ii) a $10.8 million balance of over-collected
commodity costs for the 2018 PGA, and (iii) a $4.1 million remaining balance from the $54.7 million credit to customers, caused by

the 2017 over-collection, established in the 2018 tracker. The high commodity deferral balances for winter months through March
2019 were the result of three noteworthy events last winter experienced by PSE: the Enbridge pipeline rupture, unusually low
temperatures in February and March, and a compressor failure in February at the Jackson Prairie storage facility. Additionally, to
reduce customer impact, as part of the approved PGA filing, PSE will be collecting $114.4 million commodity deferrals and related
interest over a two year period, instead of the historic one year period, from November 2019 through October 2021.
Get to Zero Depreciation Deferral
     On April 10, 2019, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission, requesting authorization to defer
depreciation expense associated with Get To Zero (GTZ) projects that were placed in service after June 30, 2018. The GTZ project
consists of a number of short-lived technology upgrades. The depreciation expense associated with the GTZ projects with lives of 10
years or less that were placed in service after June 30, 2018, were deferred beginning May 1 per the petition request. For the year
ended December 31, 2019, PSE deferred $21.7 million of depreciation expense for GTZ. In addition to the deferral of depreciation
expense, PSE had also requested to defer carrying charges on the GTZ deferral, to be calculated utilizing the Company’s currently
authorized after tax rate of return, or 6.89% per the 2018 ERF. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PSE deferred $0.5 million of
carrying charges on the deferral. The GTZ accounting petition was consolidated with PSE’s 2019 GRC and is currently being
reviewed by the Washington Commission. If authorized, both the GTZ depreciation and interest on the deferral will be begin
amortizing over three years in May 2020
Storm Damage Deferral Accounting
     The Washington Commission issued a GRC order that defined deferrable storm events and provided that costs in excess of the
annual cost threshold may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers outage criteria for system average interruption duration index. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PSE incurred
$39.3 million in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which the Company deferred
$0.4 million and $28.5 million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This compares to
$25.4 million incurred in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs for the year ended December 31,
2018, of which the Company deferred $3.3 million and $11.9 million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2017 and
2018, respectively. Under the December 5, 2017, Washington Commission order regarding PSE’s GRC, the following changes to
PSE’s storm deferral mechanism were approved: (i) the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms under the mechanism
increased from $8.0 million to $10.0 million effective January 1, 2018; and (ii) qualifying events where the total qualifying cost is less
than $0.5 million will not qualify for deferral and these costs will also not count toward the $10.0 million annual cost threshold.
Environmental Remediation
     The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to
undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations. The Company has been
named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as
potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 450,
“Contingencies,” the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly
basis. Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain
property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs of $41.8 million for natural gas
and $8.7 million for electric. The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are
recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order. The Company is
also subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Washington and
Bellingham, Washington. The Company has taken the lead for both projects, and as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s share of
future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately $31.6 million. The Company's deferred electric environmental costs are
$13.7 million and $14.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, net of insurance proceeds. The Company's deferred
natural gas environmental costs are $54.8 million and $62.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, net of insurance
proceeds. In the 2017 GRC, the Company had its third party recoveries and remediation costs incurred as of September 30, 2016, net
of a portion of insurance, approved for amortization and inclusion in rates, effective December 19, 2017.

Litigation
     From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings relating to its operations in the
normal course of business. The following is a description of pending proceedings that are material to PSE’s operations:
Colstrip
     PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 25% interest in each of Colstrip Units 3 and 4. In March 2013,
the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners in the
U.S. District Court, District of Montana. In July 2016, PSE reached a settlement with the Sierra Club to dismiss all of the Clean Air
Act allegations against the Colstrip Generating Station, which was approved by the court in September 2016. As part of the settlement
that was signed by all Colstrip owners, Colstrip 1 and 2 owners, PSE and Talen Energy Corporation (Talen), agreed to retire the two
oldest units (Units 1 and 2) at Colstrip in eastern Montana no later than July 1, 2022. Depreciation rates were updated in the GRC
effective December 19, 2017, where PSE's depreciation increased for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 to recover plant costs to the expected
shutdown date. Additionally, PSE has accelerated the depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, per the terms of the GRC settlement, to
December 31, 2027. The GRC also repurposed PTCs and hydro-related treasury grants to recover unrecovered plant costs and to fund
and recover decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip Units 1 through 4.
     Consistent with a June 2019 announcement, Talen permanently shut down Units 1 and 2 at the end of the year due to operational
losses associated with the Units. Colstrip Units 1 and 2 were retired effective December 31, 2019. The Washington Clean Energy
Transition Act requires the Washington Commission to provide recovery of the investment, decommissioning, and remediation costs
associated with the facilities that are not recovered through the repurposed PTC's and hydro-related treasury grants. The full scope of
decommissioning activities and costs may vary from the estimates that are available at this time.
     On December 10, 2019, PSE announced its intention to sell its interest in Colstrip Unit 4 to NorthWestern Energy for $1. Under
this agreement, PSE would retain its obligation to fund 25% of the environmental remediation and decommissioning costs associated
with Unit 4 during PSE's operation. The agreement is subject to approval by the Washington Commission and the Montana Public
Service Commission. Additionally, PSE has agreed to enter into a power purchase agreement with NorthWestern Energy for 90 MW
through 2025 to facilitate the transition, and sell a portion of its dedicated Colstrip transmission system, conditioned upon regulatory
approval. PSE expects external parties to intervene on the contingent purchase agreement for Colstrip Unit 4. For accounting
purposes, management has evaluated the applicable held for sale criteria as of December 31, 2019, and determined that these criteria
were not met. As such, Unit 4 is classified as Electric Utility Plant on the balance sheet, see Note 6, "Utility Plant," to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Regional Haze Rule
     In January 2017, the EPA published revisions to the Regional Haze Rule. Among other things, these revisions delayed new
Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021, however the end date will remain 2028. In January 2018, the EPA announced that it was
reconsidering certain aspects of these revisions and PSE is unable to predict the outcome. Challenges to the 2017 Regional Haze
Revision Rule are pending in abeyance in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, pending resolution of the EPA’s
reconsideration of the rule.
Clean Air Act 111(d)/EPA Affordable clean Energy Rule
      In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to
regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants. The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to
develop plans for meeting these goals. The EPA published a final rule in October 2015. In March 2017, then EPA Administrator,
Scott Pruitt, signed a notice of withdrawal of the proposed CPP federal plan and model trading rules and, in October 2017, the EPA
proposed to repeal the CPP rule.
     In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.. The
ACE rule was finalized in June 2019, and establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas
emissions from existing coal-fired plants. Compliance plans under ACE are due July 2020, and compliance generally required by July
2024. PSE is evaluating the final ACE rule to determine its impact on operations pending the outcome of the proposed Colstrip Unit 4
sale to NorthWestern Energy.

      The CAR was adopted in September 2016, in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from “covered
entities” located within Washington State. Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas
utilities, including PSE. The CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately
5.0% every three years. Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under
the rule, from others.
      In September 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed a lawsuit in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging the CAR. In September 2016, the four companies filed a similar
challenge to the CAR in Thurston County Superior Court. In March 2018, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR.
The Department of Ecology appealed the Superior Court decision in May 2018. As a result of the appeal, direct review to the
Washington State Supreme Court was granted and oral argument was held on March 16, 2019. In January 2020, the Washington
Supreme Court affirmed that CAR is not valid for “indirect emitters” meaning it does not apply to the sale of natural gas for use by
customers. The court ruled, however, that the rule can be severed and is valid for direct emitters including electric utilities with
permitted air emission sources, but remanded the case back to the Thurston County to determine which parts of the rule survive.
Meanwhile, the federal court litigation has been held in abeyance pending resolution of the state case.

Tacoma LNG Facility
      In August 2015, PSE filed a proposal with the Washington Commission to develop an LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma.
Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the facility is expected to be operational in 2021. The Tacoma LNG facility is
designed to provide peak-shaving services to PSE’s natural gas customers. By storing surplus natural gas, PSE is able to meet the
requirements of peak consumption. LNG will also provide fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market. On
January 24, 2018, Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) determined a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) was
necessary in order to rule on the air quality permit for the facility. As a result of requiring a SEIS, the Company's construction
schedule was impacted. PSE received the SEIS which concluded the LNG facility would result in a net decrease in GHG emissions
providing, in part, that the natural gas for the facility was sourced from British Columbia or Alberta. On December 10, 2019, the
PSCAA approved the Notice of Construction permit, a decision which has been appealed to the Washington Pollution Control
Hearings Board by each of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians and nonprofit law firm Earthjustice.
      Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE will be allocated approximately 43.0% of common capital and
operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility. The remaining 57.0% of common capital and
operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility will be allocated to Puget LNG. Per this allocation of costs, $199.9 million and
$165.6 million of construction work in progress related to Puget LNG's portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the Puget
Energy "Other property and investments" financial statement line item as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Additionally, $1.2 million, $2.0 million, and $0.3 million of operating costs are reported in the Puget Energy "Non-utility expense and
other" financial statement line item in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Additionally, $162.8 million and $130.8 million of
construction work in progress related to PSE’s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the PSE “Utility plant - Natural gas
plant” financial statement line item as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, as PSE is a regulated entity.

 COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
     These financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) as set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases, which is a
comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, the presentation of these financial
statements differs from generally accepted accounting principles. Certain disclosures which are required by generally accepted
accounting principles and not required by FERC have been excluded from these financial statements.
     As required by FERC, Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE) classifies certain items in its Form 1 Balance Sheet (primarily the
classification of the components of accumulated deferred income taxes, non-legal asset retirement obligations, certain miscellaneous
current and accrued liabilities, maturities of long-term debt, deferred debits and deferred credits) in a manner different than that
required by generally accepted accounting principles.
     The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
     PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering
approximately 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
Utility Plant
     PSE capitalizes, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments. Costs include indirect costs such as
engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction
(AFUDC). Replacements of minor items of property are included in maintenance expense. When the utility plant is retired and
removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the
property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
Planned Major Maintenance
     Planned major maintenance is an activity that typically occurs when PSE overhauls or substantially upgrades various systems and
equipment on a scheduled basis. Costs related to planned major maintenance are deferred and amortized to the next scheduled major
maintenance. This accounting method also follows the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington
Commission) regulatory treatment related to these generating facilities.
Other Property and Investments
     The costs of other property and investments (i.e., non-utility) are stated at historical cost. Expenditures for refurbishment and
improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized. Replacements of minor
items are expensed on a current basis. Gains and losses on assets sold or retired, which were previously recorded in utility plant, are
apportioned between regulatory assets/liabilities and earnings. However, gains and losses on assets sold or retired, not previously
recorded in utility plant, are reflected in earnings.
Depreciation and Amortization
     The Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis. Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as
regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises. The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a

                                               NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
depreciable electric utility plant was 3.4% and 3.3% in 2019 and 2018, respectively; depreciable natural gas utility plant was 2.8% in
both 2019 and 2018; and depreciable common utility plant was 7.3% and 7.1% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cost of removal is
collected from PSE’s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
Tacoma LNG Facility
     In August 2015, PSE filed a proposal with the Washington Commission to develop an LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma.
Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the facility is expected to be operational in 2021. The Tacoma LNG facility is
designed to provide peak-shaving services to PSE’s natural gas customers. By storing surplus natural gas, PSE is able to meet the
requirements of peak consumption. LNG will also provide fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market. On
January 24, 2018, Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) determined a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) was
necessary in order to rule on the air quality permit for the facility. As a result of requiring a SEIS, the Company's construction
schedule was impacted. PSE received the SEIS which concluded the LNG facility would result in a net decrease in GHG emissions
providing, in part, that the natural gas for the facility was sourced from British Columbia or Alberta. On December 10, 2019, the
PSCAA approved the Notice of Construction permit, a decision which has been appealed to the Washington Pollution Control
Hearings Board by each of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians and nonprofit law firm Earthjustice.
     Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE will be allocated approximately 43.0% of common capital and
operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility. For PSE, construction work in progress of
$162.8 million and $130.8 million related to PSE’s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the “Utility plant - Natural gas
plant” financial statement line item as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively, as PSE is a regulated entity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are reported at cost and approximate
fair value, due to the short-term maturity.
Restricted Cash
     Restricted cash amounts are primarily represent cash posted as collateral for derivative contracts as well as funds required to be set
aside for contractual obligations related to transmission and generation facilities.
Materials and Supplies
     Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and
transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity. The Company records these
items at weighted-average cost.
Fuel and Natural Gas Inventory
     Fuel and natural gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company’s natural gas
customers. Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation. Natural gas inventory consists of natural gas
and LNG held in storage for future sales. The Company records these items at the lower of cost or net realizable value method.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
     PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980, “Regulated Operations” (ASC 980). ASC 980 requires
PSE to defer certain costs or losses that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery
of such costs. It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future. Accounting
under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are
designed to recover the specific enterprise’s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set

at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and
liabilities as long-term when amortization periods extend longer than one year. For further details regarding regulatory assets and
liabilities, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates".
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
     AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending primarily upon the level of construction work in progress
and the AFUDC rate used. AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant; the AFUDC debt portion is credited to interest
expense, while the AFUDC equity portion is credited to other income. Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these
charges are reflected in rates. The current AFUDC rate authorized by the Washington Commission for natural gas and electric utility
plant additions through December 18, 2017, was 7.77%. Effective December 19, 2017, with the Washington Commission order, the
new AFUDC rate authorized is 7.60%.
     The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return. To the extent
amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income. The deferred asset is being amortized over the average
useful life of PSE’s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years.
Revenue Recognition
     Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission. PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue
is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system. The estimate calculates unbilled usage
at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer
meter readings billed. The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each tariff rate schedule to estimate the unbilled
revenues by customer.
     PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling
$236.5 million and $239.3 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis
in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
     PSE's electric and natural gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery
revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with
authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue and gross margin erosion due to
weather and energy efficiency. Any differences in revenue are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability
for over recovery under alternative revenue recognition standard. Revenue is recognized under this program when deemed collectible
within 24 months based on alternative revenue recognition guidance. Decoupled rate increases are effective May 1 of each year
subject to a 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules. Any excess revenue above 3.0% will be included in the following
year's decoupled rate. The Company will be able to recognize revenue below the 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate
schedules. For revenue deferrals exceeding the annual 3.0% rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules, the Company will
assess the excess amount to determine its ability to be collected within 24 months. On December 5, 2017, the Washington
Commission approved PSE’s request within the 2017 general rate case (GRC) to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes
to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017. The rate test which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its
annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers. The Company
will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period
in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously
non-recognized amounts will be recognized. Revenues associated with energy costs under the power cost adjustment (PCA)
mechanism and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanism are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
     Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience
rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook. The allowance account is adjusted

monthly for this experience rate. The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is
considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off. The Company’s balance
for allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2019, and 2018, was $8.3 million and $8.4 million, respectively.
Self-Insurance
     PSE is self-insured for storm damage and certain environmental contamination associated with current operations occurring on
PSE-owned property. In addition, PSE is required to meet a deductible for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive
liability, workers’ compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related. Under the
December 5, 2017, Washington Commission order regarding PSE’s GRC, the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms
under the mechanism increased from $8.0 million to $10.0 million effective January 1, 2018. Additionally, costs may only be deferred
if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration
index.
Federal Income Taxes
     For presentation in PSE’s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate
company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate
company.
Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release
     PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak
winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers. Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by
most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in
excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system. For much of the year, there is excess
capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases. PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into
natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas
pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity
for its core natural gas customers. The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the
cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income. As a
result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
     As part of the Company’s electric operations, PSE purchases natural gas for its gas-fired generation facilities. The projected
volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas. Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the
natural gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas. The net proceeds from
selling natural gas, previously purchased for power generation, are accounted for in electric operating revenue and are included in the
PCA mechanism.
Accounting for Derivatives
     ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" (ASC 815) requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on
the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception. PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its
energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps. Some of PSE’s
physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules. PSE
may enter into financial fixed price contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts. Those contracts
that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under
ASC 980, for natural gas related derivatives due to the PGA mechanism. For additional information, see Note 9, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities".

      ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). As
permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a
practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes
market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the
risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally
unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the
approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation
techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
      The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service. When
external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility
assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price
curves. All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis. For additional information,
see Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements".
Debt Related Costs
      Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related
debt for the Company. The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related
new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE and presented net of long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.
Leases
      PSE determines if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception of the contract. If the arrangement is, or contains a lease,
PSE assesses whether the lease is operating or financing for income statement and balance sheet classification. Operating and Finance
leases are included in utility plant, other current liabilities, and other deferred credits in our consolidated balance sheets.
      ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and consist of the amount of the initial measurement
of the lease liability, any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received,
and any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the
lease and are measured at present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at
commencement. As most of PSE's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, PSE uses the incremental borrowing rate based on
the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. For fleet, IT and wind farm
leases, this rate is applied using a portfolio approach. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is
reasonably certain that PSE will exercise that option. On the statement of income, operating leases are generally accounted for under a
straight-line expense model, while finance leases, which were previously referred to as capital leases, are generally accounted for under
a financing model. Consistent with the previous lease guidance, however, the standard allows rate-regulated utilities to recognize
expense consistent with the timing of recovery in rates.
PSE has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components comprise common area maintenance and
utilities, and are accounted for separately from lease components.
Subsequent Events
      On January 21, 2020, the first Coronavirus case in the United States was confirmed in Washington State, followed by the first
virus-related death on February 29, 2020, also in Washington in the Company’s service territory. On March 3, 2020, the Mayor of
Seattle declared a state of emergency in response to the Coronavirus outbreak and increasing death toll. Local companies, PSE
included, instructed employees to work remotely if at all possible. Governor Jay Inslee subsequently banned gatherings of more than
50 people in multiple counties, required all restaurants and bars be closed except for take-out and deliveries, and cancelled all schools
through April 24, 2020. President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020, as a result of the outbreak. On March 23,
2020, Governor Jay Inslee issued a Stay at Home – Stay Healthy Order throughout Washington State by prohibiting all people in
Washington State from leaving their homes or participating in social, spiritual and recreational gatherings of any kind regardless of the
number of participants, and all non-essential businesses in Washington State from conducting business. On April 6, 2020, Governor
Jay Inslee ordered all Washington schools closed for the school year. The situation continues to be dynamic, with potential increases

and extensions to these restrictions anticipated.
     The Company responded to the extraordinary event, implementing a number of changes intended to protect customers, employees,
and the communities in our service territory. These include not disconnecting customers for non-payment, receiving Commission
approval to waive late fees, and filing a motion with the Commission to waive the statutory deadline for the Company’s General Rate
Case for up to 60 days, from May 20, 2020, until July 20, 2020. This is expected to impact financial results for the Company in 2020,
but does not impact any balances or estimates in the 2019 Financial Statements. The extent of the 2020 impact is not currently known
nor estimable.
     The Company evaluates events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued
for potential recognition or disclosures in the financial statements. The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date the
financial statements were filed with the FERC, and no additional disclosures are required.
(2) New Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
Lease Accounting
     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)". The FASB issued this ASU to increase transparency
and comparability among organizations by recognizing right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing
key information about leasing arrangements. To meet that objective, the FASB amended the FASB ASC and created Topic 842,
Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the
commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. The income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification.
Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged.
     In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to
Topic 842". In connection with the FASB’s transition support efforts, the amendments in this update provide an optional transition
practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases
under the current guidance in Topic 840. An entity that elects this practical expedient should evaluate new or modified land easements
under Topic 842 upon adoption. Land easements (also commonly referred to as rights of way) represent the right to use, access, or
cross another entity’s land for a specified purpose. The Company elected this practical expedient.
     In July 2018, the FASB issued both ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11, "Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements" and
"Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements". These ASUs provide entities with both clarification on existing guidance issued in
ASU 2016-02, as well as an additional transition method to adopt the new leasing standard. Under the new transition method, the entity
initially applies the new standard at the adoption date by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity's reporting for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements
will continue to be in accordance with Topic 840. The Company has elected to adopt the standard using this new modified transition
method.
     In preparation for adoption of the standard, the Company assembled a project team that met bi-weekly to make key accounting
assessments and perform pre-implementation controls related to the scoping and completeness of existing leases. Additionally, the
Company implemented a new leasing system and drafted accounting policies including discount rate, variable pricing, power purchase
agreements, and election of practical expedients. In addition to the land easement practical expedient, the Company has elected the
practical expedient package.
     These amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has adopted ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2019, which resulted in the
recognition of right-of-use asset and lease liabilities that have not previously been recorded and are material to the balance sheet.
Under FERC Docket AI-19-1-000, operating leases are not required to be capitalized and reported in the balance sheet accounts
established for capital leases. However, a jurisdictional entity is permitted to implement the ASU's guidance to report operating leases
with a lease term in excess of 12 months as right of use assets, with corresponding lease obligations, in the balance sheet accounts

established for capital leases. Accordingly the Company’s operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet in Account 101.1
(Property Under Capital Leases), Account 227 (Obligations Under Capital Leases- Noncurrent), and Account 243 (Obligations Under
Capital Leases — Current). Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the income statement. The financial impact as
of the date of adoption was not materially different than what has been disclosed as of December 31, 2019, in Note 8, "Leases".
Internal-Use Software
     In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):
Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract". These
amendments align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract
with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting
arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a
service contract is not affected by these amendments. While the standard requires that the capitalized implementation costs be reported
on the balance sheet in the same manner as a prepayment and the related amortization expense in the same expense line item on the
income statement as the expense for the associated cloud computing arrangement, the Company capitalizes implementation costs
associated with cloud computing arrangements as a utility plant asset and amortizes the costs in a consistent manner in accordance with
FERC Docket Number AI90-1-000.
     The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted, including adoption in any
interim period, for all entities. The amendments in this update should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all
implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company adopted this update prospectively in 2019 for implementation
costs incurred in hosting arrangements and application of the amendment did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Adopted
Credit Losses
     In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments". The amendments in the update change how entities account for credit losses on receivables and certain
other assets. The guidance requires use of a current expected loss model, which may result in earlier recognition of credit losses than
under previous accounting standards. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15,
2019. The Company has analyzed its financial instruments within the scope of the guidance and does not expect a material impact to
the consolidated financial statements..
Fair Value Measurement
     In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the
Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement". The guidance in ASU No. 2018-13 eliminates such disclosures as the amount
of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The amendments in ASU No. 2018-13 add new
disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. ASU No. 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures. Certain
disclosures in ASU No. 2018-13 are required to be applied on a retrospective basis and others on a prospective basis. As the
amendment contemplates changes in disclosures only, it will have no material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash
flows, or consolidated balance sheet.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
     Regulatory accounting allows PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future
rates will permit recovery of such costs. It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers
in the future.
     The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019, and 2018, included the following:

(a)   Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions.
The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.

      If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be
required to write-off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
      In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO),” PSE reclassified
from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $469.9 million and $424.7 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the cost
of removal of utility plant. These amounts are collected from PSE’s customers through depreciation rates.
General Rate Case Filing
      PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas
rates of 6.9% and 7.9% respectively. PSE requested a return on equity of 9.8% with an overall rate of return of 7.62%. In addition to
the traditional areas of focus (revenue requirements, cost allocation, rate design and cost of capital), the Company completed an
attrition study and included a portion of the attrition revenue requirement in the overall request in order address the expected
regulatory lag in the rate year. Additionally, as the non-plant related excess deferred taxes that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) remained outstanding from PSE’s Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) as discussed below, PSE requested in its GRC to pass back the
amounts over four years. On September 17, 2019, PSE filed a supplemental filing in the GRC, which provided updates as discussed in
our original filing, but did not impact the requested overall electric and natural gas rate increases, return on equity or overall rate of
return as originally filed. On January 15, 2020, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested return on
equity to 9.5%, which decreased the rate of return to 7.48%. The requested rate increase for both electric and natural gas remained at
6.9% and 7.9%, respectively. For both electric and natural gas PSE did not originally request its full attrition adjustment; therefore, the
decrease in return on equity led to a reduction in the electric rate increase of only $1.5 million and did not have an impact on the
natural gas rate increase.
      In January 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission. The GRC filing included a required plan to address
Colstrip Units 1 and 2 closures, requested that electric energy supply fixed costs be included in PSE's decoupling mechanism, and
contained requests for two new mechanisms to address regulatory lag. The Washington Commission entered a final order accepting
the multi-party settlement agreement and determined the contested issues in the case on December 5, 2017, and new rates became
effective December 19, 2017. The settlement agreement provided for a weighted cost of capital of 7.6%, or 6.55% after-tax, and a
capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.5%. The settlement also resulted in a combined electric tariff
change that resulted in a net increase of $20.2 million, or 0.9%, annually, and a combined natural gas tariff change that resulted in a net

decrease of $35.5 million, or 3.8%, annually.
     The 2017 GRC also re-purposed the benefit of hydro-related treasury grants to fund and recover decommissioning and
remediation costs for Colstrip Units 1 and 2.
     The Company responded to the COVID-19 situation, in part, by implementing a number of changes intended to protect customers,
employees, and the communities in our service territory. These include not disconnecting customers for non-payment, receiving
Commission approval to waive late fees, and filing a motion with the Commission to waive the statutory deadline for the Company’s
General Rate Case for up to 60 days, from May 20, 2020, until July 20, 2020. This is expected to impact financial results for the
Company in 2020, but does not impact any balances or estimates in the 2019 Financial Statements. The extent of the 2020 impact is
not currently known nor estimable.
Expedited Rate Filing Rate Adjustment
     On November 7, 2018, PSE filed an expedited rate filing (ERF) with the Washington Commission. The filing requested to change
rates associated with PSE’s delivery and fixed production costs. It did not include variable power costs, purchased gas costs or natural
gas pipeline replacement program costs, which are recovered in separate mechanisms. The filing was based on historical test year
costs and rate base, and followed the reporting requirements of a Commission Basis Report, as defined by the Washington
Administrative Code, but used end of period rate base and certain annualizing adjustments. It did not include any forward-looking or
pro-forma adjustments. Included in the filing was a reduction to the overall authorized rate of return from 7.6% to 7.49% to recognize
a reduction in debt costs associated with recent debt activity. PSE requested an overall increase in electric rates of $18.9 million
annually, which is a 0.9% increase, and an overall increase in natural gas rates of $21.7 million annually, which is a 2.7% increase.
     On January 22, 2019, all parties in the proceeding reached an agreement on settlement terms that resolved all issues in the filing.
The settlement agreement was filed on January 30, 2019. The parties agreed to a $21.5 million for natural gas and no rate increase for
electric which became effective March 1, 2019. As is discussed below, these rates include the offsetting effect of passing back to
customers plant related excess deferred income taxes that resulted from the TCJA, using the average rate assumption method (ARAM)
amounts to arrive at the settlement rate changes.
     The settlement agreement provides for the pass back of plant related excess deferred income taxes that resulted from the TCJA
using the ARAM methodology based on 2018 amounts beginning March 1, 2019, in the amount of $6.1 million for natural gas
customers and $25.9 million for electric customers. The settlement agreement left the determination for the regulatory treatment of the
remaining items related to the TCJA, listed below, to PSE’s next GRC, filed June 20, 2019:
       1) excess deferred taxes for non-plant-related book/tax differences for periods prior to March 1, 2019,
       the deferred balance associated with the over-collection of income tax expense for the period January 1 through April 30, 2018
            (the time period that encompasses the effective date of the TCJA to May 1, 2018, the effective date of the TCJA rate
            change); and
       the turnaround of plant related excess deferred income taxes using the ARAM method for the period from January 2018 through
            February 2019, the rate effective date for the ERF.
     The agreement provides that PSE may defer the depreciation expense associated with PSE’s ongoing investment in its advanced
metering infrastructure (AMI) investment and may defer the return on the AMI investment that was included in the test year of the
filing. The agreement preserves the parties' rights to argue whether or not these deferrals should be recovered in the Company’s 2019
GRC. The rate of return adopted in the settlement for reporting and deferral purposes is 7.49% . On February 21, 2019, the
Washington Commission approved the settlement with one condition: PSE must pass back the deferred balance associated with the tax
over-collection of $34.6 million for the period from January 1, 2018, through April 30, 2018, over a one-year period which began May
1, 2019.
Washington Commission Tax Deferral Filing
     The TCJA was signed into law in December 2017. As a result of this change, PSE re-measured its deferred tax balances under the
new corporate tax rate. PSE filed an accounting petition on December 29, 2017, requesting deferred accounting treatment for the
impacts of tax reform. The requested deferral accounting treatment resulted in the tax rate change being captured in the deferred
income tax balance with an offset to the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes for GAAP purposes. Additionally, on March 30,

2018, PSE filed for a rate change for electric and natural gas customers associated with TCJA to reflect the decrease in the federal
corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%. The overall impact of the rate change, based on the annual period from May 2018
through April 2019, is a revenue decrease of $72.9 million, or 3.4%, for electric and $23.6 million, or 2.7%, for natural gas and
became effective May 1, 2018, by operation of law.
     The March 30, 2018, rate change filing did not address excess deferred taxes or the deferred balance associated with the
over-collection of income tax expense of $34.6 million for the period January 1 through April 30, 2018 (the time period that
encompasses the effective date of the TCJA through May 1, 2018, the effective date of the rate change). The $34.6 million tax
over-collection decreased PSE's revenue and increased the regulatory liability for a refund to customers.
     As a result of the Washington Commission's final order in the ERF, the excess deferred taxes associated with non-plant-related
book/tax differences and the treatment of the excess deferred taxes associated with plant related book/tax differences from January 1,
2019, through February 28, 2019, was addressed in PSE’s GRC, which was filed on June 20, 2019. The Washington Commission also
required in the ERF order that PSE pass back the deferred balance associated with the tax over-collection for the period from January
1, 2018, through April 30, 2018, as discussed above, over a one-year period which began May 1, 2019.
Decoupling Filings
     While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to
month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Since July
2013, the Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues
related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from most residential,
commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns
per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual
consumption levels. PSE's energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling
mechanism. The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
 Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and
the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period.
     On December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE’s request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling
mechanism with several changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017. Electric and natural gas delivery
revenues continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs are now decoupled and recovered
on the basis of a fixed monthly amount. The allowed decoupling revenue for electric and natural gas customers will no longer increase
annually each January 1 as occurred prior to December 19, 2017. Approved revenue per customer costs can only be changed in a GRC
or ERF. Approved electric fixed production energy costs can also be changed in a power cost only rate case (PCORC). Other changes
to the decoupling methodology approved by the Washington Commission include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential
customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward. The rate test, which limits
the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings, increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at
3.0% for electric customers. The decoupling mechanism will be reviewed again in PSE’s first rate case filed in or after 2021, or in a
separate proceeding, if appropriate. PSE’s decoupling mechanism over- and under- collections will still be collectible or refundable
after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
     On February 21, 2019, the Washington Commission approved the multi-party settlement agreement which was filed within PSE’s
ERF filing. As part of this settlement agreement, electric and natural gas allowed delivery revenue per customer was updated to reflect
changes in the approved revenue requirement. For electric, there were no changes to the annual allowed fixed power cost revenue. The
changes took effect on March 1, 2019.
     On December 31, 2019, PSE performed an analysis to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be
collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980. If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE would need to
record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and regulatory asset balance. Once the reserve is probable of collection within 24
months from the end of the annual period, the reserve can be recognized as decoupling revenue. The analysis indicated that electric
and natural gas deferred revenue will be collected within 24 months of the annual period; therefore, no adjustment was booked to 2019
decoupling revenue. The previously unrecognized decoupling deferral of $0.8 million at December 31, 2018, was recognized as
decoupling revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism
     PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the “power cost baseline” level of
power costs. The “power cost baseline” levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric
conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in
the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
      Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism:
                                                                                      Company’s Share         Customers' Share

 Over or Under Collected beyond $40 + million                                          10           10           90          90
     In September 2016, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission which requested deferral of the variances,
either positive or negative, between the fixed costs previously recovered in the PCA and the revenue received to cover the allowed
fixed costs. The deferral period requested was January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, when rates were to go into effect from
PSE's 2017 GRC. In November 2016, the Washington Commission issued Order No. 01 approving PSE’s accounting petition. With
the final determination in PSE’s GRC, this deferral ceased with the rate effective date of December 19, 2017.
     For the year ended December 31, 2019, in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its allowable costs by $67.2 million of which
$36.0 million was apportioned to customers and $1.0 million of interest was accrued on the deferred customer balance. This compares
to an under recovery of allowable costs of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, of which no amounts were apportioned
to customers and accrued $0.2 million of interest on the total deferred customer balance. Power costs have been higher than the
allowed base line in 2019 which has led to an increase in the PCA deferral causing a higher under-collection compared to the prior
year. Actual power costs were higher than baseline rates in 2018 also but by a narrower margin, resulting in lower under-collection.
Power prices increased during 2019 as compared to the prior year due to: (i) Cold weather in February and early March, which drove
regional loads and demand for power up; (ii) Westcoast pipeline capacity limitations, which contributed to higher natural gas and
power prices; (iii) An outage on a transmission line, which contributed to a liquidity crisis at Mid-C and resulted in high market power
prices; and (iv) The relative prices of natural gas and power, which reduced the supply of natural gas-fired generation and increased the
demand for market power, increasing prices.
Purchased Gas Adjustment
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, PSE had a beginning PGA payable balance of $16.1 million, incurred actual natural gas
costs of $319.3 million, of which $292.0 million was recovered through rates. The difference between actual and allowed costs, less
interest $1.3 million, resulted in a PGA receivable of $9.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PSE had incurred actual
natural gas costs of $406.2 million, of which $289.9 million was recovered through rates. The difference between actual and allowed
costs, plus interest of $6.6 million, resulted in a PGA receivable of $132.8 million.
     On April 25, 2019, the Washington Commission approved PSE’s request for an out-of-cycle change to PGA rates with the rate
change taking effect May 1, 2019. The out-of-cycle PGA filing was needed to begin amortizing a large PGA commodity deferral
balance that had grown due to higher than projected commodity costs during the 2018/19 winter. These higher than projected
commodity costs were primarily due to an October 9, 2018, rupture and subsequent explosion on Westcoast Pipeline which is one of
the major pipelines feeding PSE’s distribution system. The pipeline was repaired in October 2018, however supply capacity on the
pipeline was limited over the 2018/19 winter leading to higher prices. February weather was also much colder than normal which also
increased the demand for natural gas. The amortization period will be from May 2019 through April 2020.
     On October 24, 2019, the Washington Commission approved PSE’s request for November 2019 PGA rates, with the rate change
taking effect on November 1, 2019. As part of that filing, PSE requested PGA rates increase annual revenue by $17.8 million, while

the new tracker rates increased by annual revenue of $100.6 million; this was in addition to continuing the collection on the remaining
balance of $54.0 million from the out-of-cycle PGA. The tracker rates include deferral balances for the three separate amounts: (i)
$114.4 million of under collected commodity balances deferred in February and March; (ii) a $10.8 million balance of over-collected
commodity costs for the 2018 PGA, and (iii) a $4.1 million remaining balance from the $54.7 million credit to customers, caused by
the 2017 over-collection, established in the 2018 tracker. The high commodity deferral balances for winter months through March
2019 were the result of three noteworthy events last winter experienced by PSE: the Enbridge pipeline rupture, unusually low
temperatures in February and March, and a compressor failure in February at the Jackson Prairie storage facility. Additionally, to
reduce customer impact, as part of the approved PGA filing, PSE will be collecting $114.4 million commodity deferrals and related
interest over a two year period, instead of the historic one year period, from November 2019 through October 2021.
Get to Zero Depreciation Deferral
     On April 10, 2019, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission, requesting authorization to defer
depreciation expense associated with Get To Zero (GTZ) projects that were placed in service after June 30, 2018. The GTZ project
consists of a number of short-lived technology upgrades. The depreciation expense associated with the GTZ projects with lives of 10
years or less that were placed in service after June 30, 2018, were deferred beginning May 1 per the petition request. For the year
ended December 31, 2019, PSE deferred $21.7 million of depreciation expense for GTZ. In addition to the deferral of depreciation
expense, PSE had also requested to defer carrying charges on the GTZ deferral, to be calculated utilizing the Company’s currently
authorized after tax rate of return, or 6.89% per the 2018 ERF. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PSE deferred $0.5 million of
carrying charges on the deferral. The GTZ accounting petition was consolidated with PSE’s 2019 GRC and is currently being
reviewed by the Washington Commission. If authorized, both the GTZ depreciation and interest on the deferral will be begin
amortizing over three years in May 2020
Storm Damage Deferral Accounting
     The Washington Commission issued a GRC order that defined deferrable storm events and provided that costs in excess of the
annual cost threshold may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers outage criteria for system average interruption duration index. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PSE incurred
$39.3 million in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which the Company deferred
$0.4 million and $28.5 million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This compares to
$25.4 million incurred in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs for the year ended December 31,
2018, of which the Company deferred $3.3 million and $11.9 million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2017 and
2018, respectively. Under the December 5, 2017, Washington Commission order regarding PSE’s GRC, the following changes to
PSE’s storm deferral mechanism were approved: (i) the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms under the mechanism
increased from $8.0 million to $10.0 million effective January 1, 2018; and (ii) qualifying events where the total qualifying cost is less
than $0.5 million will not qualify for deferral and these costs will also not count toward the $10.0 million annual cost threshold.
Environmental Remediation
     The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to
undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations. The Company has been
named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as
potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 450,
“Contingencies,” the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly
basis. Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain
property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs of $41.8 million for natural gas
and $8.7 million for electric. The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are
recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order. The Company is
also subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Washington and
Bellingham, Washington. The Company has taken the lead for both projects, and as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s share of
future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately $31.6 million. The Company's deferred electric environmental costs are
$13.7 million and $14.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, net of insurance proceeds. The Company's deferred

natural gas environmental costs are $54.8 million and $62.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, net of insurance
proceeds. In the 2017 GRC, the Company had its third party recoveries and remediation costs incurred as of September 30, 2016, net
of a portion of insurance, approved for amortization and inclusion in rates, effective December 19, 2017.
(4) Dividend Payment Restrictions
     The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt
contained in PSE’s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. At December 31, 2019, approximately $914.2 million of unrestricted
retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
     Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE’s common
equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington
Commission. Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution
PSE’s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE’s ratio of earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods
prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0. The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.4% at
December 31, 2019, and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.3 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
     PSE’s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay
dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default,
such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
     At December 31, 2019, PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of
dividends.

     In June 2019, Talen, the plant operator of Colstrip 1&2, announced a plan to shut down as of December 31, 2019. The Company
retired Colstrip 1&2 from Utility Plant and transferred the unrecovered plant amount of $126.5 million to regulatory assets. Consistent
with the GRC settlement in 2017, monetization of the PTCs will fund the following: (i) Colstrip Community Transition Fund, (ii)
unrecovered Colstrip plant and (iii) incurred decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip. At December 31, 2019, the
unrecovered plant for Colstrip 1&2 was fully offset with PTCs.

distribution and transmission poles, natural gas mains, and leased facilities where disposal is governed by ASC 410 “Asset Retirement
and Environmental Obligations" (ARO).
     On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR)
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The CCR ruling requires the Company to perform an extensive study
on the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health. The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of
contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash surface
impoundments.
     The CCR rule and two new legal agreements which include a consent decree with the Sierra Club and a settlement agreement with
the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation in 2016 make significant changes to the Company’s Colstrip operations and those
changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in 2015 and 2016. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation in
2003 under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip.
     The actual ARO costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased
obligation due to uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to
estimate costs. We will continue to gather additional data and coordinate with the plant operator to make decisions about compliance
strategies and the timing of closure activities. As additional information becomes available, the Company will update the ARO
obligation for these changes, which could be material.
     For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company reviewed the estimated remediation costs at Colstrip and
increased the Colstrip ARO liability by $4.2 million for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and $0.5 million for Colstrip Units 3 and 4. The 2019
increase to the Colstrip ARO liability are primarily due to accelerated timing of activities due to the closure of Colstrip Units 1 and 2 at
the end of 2019. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the company reduced the Colstrip ARO liability by $11.0 million
for Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and increased $1.8 million for Colstrip Units 3 and 4. The 2018 change to the Colstrip ARO liability is
primarily based on the plant site remedy report approved by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company also recorded the Colstrip relief of liability of $12.4 million and
$4.8 million, respectively. In addition, the Company recorded Tacoma LNG facility ARO liability of $3.0 million and $2.7 million for
PSE as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The 2019 increase to the Tacoma LNG facility ARO liability is
primarily due to continued construction of the plant.

     The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, “ARO,” which were not recognized because the
liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2019:
     1     A legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are
           not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales. The disposal cost related to these facilities could not be measured since the
           retirement date is indeterminable; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated;
     An obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon
           termination of the project. Since the project is expected to continue as long as the Northwest pipeline continues to operate,
           the liability cannot be reasonably estimated;
     An obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines. The
           major transmission lines are expected to be used indefinitely; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated;
     A legal obligation under Washington state environmental laws to remove and properly dispose of certain under and above ground
           fuel storage tanks. The disposal costs related to under and above ground storage tanks could not be measured since the
           retirement date is indeterminable; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated;
     An obligation to pay decommissioning costs at the end of utility service franchise agreements to restore the surface of the
           franchise area. The decommissioning costs related to facilities at the franchise area could not be measured since the
           decommissioning date is indeterminable; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated; and
     A potential legal obligation may arise upon the expiration of an existing FERC hydropower license if FERC orders the project to
           be decommissioned, although PSE contends that FERC does not have such authority. Given the value of ongoing generation,
           flood control and other benefits provided by these projects, PSE believes that the potential for decommissioning is remote and
           cannot be reasonably estimated.

1.   5.500% Promissory Note in the amount of $2.4 million was classified on the Balance Sheet as a current maturity of long-term debt as of August 12, 2019.
     PSE's senior secured notes will cease to be secured by the pledged first mortgage bonds on the date that all of the first mortgage
bonds issued and outstanding under the electric or natural gas utility mortgage indenture have been retired. As of December 31, 2019,
the latest maturity date of the first mortgage bonds, other than pledged first mortgage bonds, is December 22, 2025.
Puget Sound Energy Long-Term Debt
     On August 2, 2019, PSE filed a new shelf registration statement under which it may issue, up to $1.0 billion aggregate principal
amount of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds. As of the date of this report, $550.0 million was available under the
registration. The shelf registration will expire in August 2022.
     Substantially all utility properties owned by PSE are subject to the lien of the Company’s electric and natural gas mortgage
indentures. To issue additional first mortgage bonds under these indentures, PSE’s earnings available for interest must exceed certain
minimums as defined in the indentures. At December 31, 2019, the earnings available for interest exceeded the required amount.
     On March 5, 2018, PSE commenced a tender offer and related consent solicitation to purchase any and all of the outstanding
$250.0 million 6.974% Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes due June 1, 2067. Holders of the notes received $1,005 per
$1,000 principal amount of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest for notes tendered and accepted by the early tender payment
deadline of March 16, 2018. Holders of notes tendered after the early tender payment deadline, but prior to the tender offer expiration
on April 2, 2018, were to receive the tender offer consideration of $975 per $1,000 of principal amount of the notes plus accrued but
unpaid interest. A total of $193.4 million in principal amount of notes were tendered by the early payment deadline and no notes were

amount included the principal, early tender consideration and accrued interest up to, but not including March 20, 2018.
     Concurrently with the tender offer, PSE solicited consents from a majority (in principal amount) of the holders of PSE’s 6.274%

of the covenant was necessary because it included restrictions related to repurchases, redemptions and repayments of the 6.974%
Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes. PSE received consents from holders of 87.7% of the 6.274% Senior Notes and paid a
consent fee totaling $2.6 million to those holders on March 19, 2018.
     On March 28, 2018, PSE issued a notice of redemption, effective April 27, 2018, for the remaining $56.6 million principal
amount of the 6.974% Series A Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding the redemption date.
     On June 4, 2018, PSE issued $600.0 million of 30-year Senior Notes under its senior note indenture at an interest rate of 4.223%
with a maturity date of June 15, 2048. The proceeds from the issuance were used to pay the principal and accrued interest on the
Company’s $200.0 million Secured Notes that matured on June 15, 2018, outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $348.0 million
and other general corporate expenses.
      On August 30, 2019, PSE issued $450.0 million of senior notes at an interest rate of 3.250%. The notes pay interest
semi-annually and are due to mature on September 15, 2049. Proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay outstanding short
term debt under the Company’s commercial paper program.

(7) Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements
     As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, PSE had $176.0 million and $379.3 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively.
PSE’s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt
issuance costs, during 2019 and 2018 was 3.4% and 3.4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, PSE had several committed credit
facilities that are described below.
Puget Sound Energy
Credit Facility
     In October 2017, PSE entered into a new $800.0 million credit facility which consolidates the two previous facilities into a single,
smaller facility. All other features including fees, interest rate options, letter of credit, same day swingline borrowings, financial
covenant and accordion feature remain substantially the same. The credit facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day
availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million. The credit facility also has an expansion feature which, upon the banks' approval,
would increase the total size of the facility to $1.4 billion. On September 25, 2019, with no changes to the size, terms or conditions,

the maturity of the unsecured revolving credit facility was extended for one year. The facility now matures in October 2023.
     The credit agreement is syndicated among numerous lenders and contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants
that, among other things, places limitations on PSE's ability to transact with affiliates, make asset dispositions and investments or
permit liens to exist. The credit agreement also contains a financial covenant of total debt to total capitalization of 65% or less. PSE
certifies its compliance with such covenants to participating banks each quarter. As of December 31, 2019, PSE was in compliance
with all applicable covenant ratios.
     The credit agreement provides PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options. The credit agreement allows PSE to
borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the LIBOR plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility. The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's
credit ratings. As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 1.25% and the commitment fee is 0.175%.
     As of December 31, 2019, no amounts were drawn and outstanding under PSE's credit facility. No letters of credit were
outstanding and $176.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program. Outside of the credit agreement, PSE had a
$2.8 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas
purchases in Canada.
Demand Promissory Note
     In 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a demand
promissory note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget
Energy. Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average
interest rates of PSE’s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE’s senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Absent such
borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%. As of December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance under
the Note.
(8) Leases
     PSE has operating leases for buildings for corporate offices and operations, real estate for operating facilities and the PSE and
PLNG LNG facility, land for our wind farms, and vehicles for PSE’s fleet. The finance leases are for office printers. The leases have
remaining lease terms of less than a year to 50 years. PSE's ROU assets and lease liabilities include options to extend leases when it is
reasonably certain that PSE will exercise that option.
     During the fourth quarter of 2019, PSE became reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend its lease at the Port of Tacoma
for an additional 25 years as a result of the approval of the Notice of Construction permit for the Tacoma LNG facility. This
remeasurement resulted in an increase of the Operating lease right-of-use asset and Operating lease liabilities of $14.7 million.
     The components of lease cost were as follows:
                                                                                                                   Year Ended

(9) Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
      PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of
realizing speculative trading revenue. The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted
electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing
mechanism of the PCA. Therefore, wholesale market transactions and PSE's related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs
and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio. In order to manage its exposure to the variability in future
cash flows for forecasted energy transactions, PSE utilizes a programmatic hedging strategy which extends out three years. PSE's
hedging strategy includes a risk-responsive component for the core natural gas portfolio, which utilizes quantitative risk-based
measures with defined objectives to balance both portfolio risk and hedge costs.
      PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools. In order to
manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating
swap contracts, and commodity call/put options. Currently, the Company does not apply cash flow hedge accounting, and therefore
records all mark-to-market gains or losses through earnings.
      The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities. The Company
utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term
funding needs. The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk
associated with these debts.
      The following table presents the volumes, fair values and classification of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the

All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, “Regulated Operations,” due to the
      PGA mechanism. The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of
      physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1     Electric portfolio derivatives consist of electric generation fuel of 229.3 million One Million British Thermal Units (MMBtus) and purchased electricity of
      10.4 million megawatt hours (MWhs) at December 31, 2019, and 194.8 million MMBtus and 6.6 million MWhs at December 31, 2018.
      It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level without offsetting assets or
liabilities. The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements,
which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements, which standardize
financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements, which standardize
physical natural gas contracts. The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements

     The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement. The Company manages credit
risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, and exposure
monitoring and mitigation.
     The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default rates, credit rating changes by external rating
agencies, ownership changes or financial distress. Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security
from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses. Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the
perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
     It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or
more counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer
a material financial loss. However, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 95.0% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure,
excluding normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) transactions, is with counterparties that are rated investment grade by rating agencies
and 5.0% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies. The Company assesses credit risk internally for
counterparties that are not rated by the major rating agencies.
     The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty. The Company considers external credit
ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves. The Company recognizes
that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default. The Company uses
both default factors published by Standard & Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application
of an industry standard recovery rate. The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level
based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals. The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and
contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value. The default factor used is dependent upon whether the
counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
     The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
 The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the
risk-free rate. Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in a net
liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on

within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. PSE also transacts power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange
(ICE), and natural gas contracts on the ICE NGX exchange platform. Execution of contracts on ICE requires the daily posting of
margin calls as collateral through a futures and clearing agent. As of December 31, 2019, PSE had cash posted as collateral of
$14.8 million related to contracts executed on the ICE platform. Also, as of December 31, 2019, PSE has a $1.0 million letter of credit
posted as collateral as a condition of transacting on the ICE NGX exchange. PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any
of its counterparties during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post
collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.

(10) Fair Value Measurements
     ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy categorizes the
inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy are as follows:
           Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
           Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities. Equity
           securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in
           active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
           Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly
           or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using
           models or other valuation methodologies. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such
           as over-the-counter forwards and options.

           Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date. These
           inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
      Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety in the appropriate fair value hierarchy based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their
placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3
using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches. The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of
the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer. Inputs used to estimate the fair
value of forwards, swaps and options include market-price curves, contract terms and prices, credit-risk adjustments, and discount
factors. Additionally, for options, the Black-Scholes option valuation model and implied market volatility curves are used. Inputs
used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs as substantially all assumptions and inputs are
observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments. On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices
for the electric and natural gas markets from an independent external pricing service.
     The Company considers its electric and natural gas contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly
traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes. However, certain energy derivative instruments with
maturity dates falling outside the range of observable price quotes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Management's
assessment is based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets. Each quarter, the Company
confirms the validity of pricing-service quoted prices used to value Level 2 commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity
contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
Assets and Liabilities with Estimated Fair Value
     The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term debt as reported on the balance sheet are
reasonable estimates of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value
hierarchy. The carrying value of other investments of $51.5 million and $49.5 million at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively,
are included in "Other property and investments" on the balance sheet. These values are also reasonable estimates of their fair value
and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on market rates for similar transactions.
The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S.
Treasury yields and Company's credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue. The carrying values and
estimated fair values were as follows:

Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative
instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
     In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent
external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes. To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts
extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3. The
actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa. The
changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table
above. The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from
the independent pricing service. In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month
regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices. Such transactions are classified as Level 3. The
Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
     The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the
forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
     Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2019:

1 The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
     The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they
were adjusted. Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would
result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Generally, interrelationships exist between market
prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power
markets. At December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change
the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $2.5 million.
(11) Employee Investment Plans
     The Company's Investment Plan is a qualified employee 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax
contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options. PSE’s contributions to the employee Investment Plan
were $21.7 million and $20.7 million for the years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The employee Investment Plan eligibility
requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
     Non-represented employees and United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry
(UA) represented employees hired before January 1, 2014, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77
(IBEW) represented employees hired before December 12, 2014, have the following company contributions:

     1.  For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to
         6.0% of plan compensation each paycheck, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1.0% of base pay.
     For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55.0% of an employee’s
         contribution up to 6.0% of plan compensation each paycheck.
     Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 along with IBEW-represented employees hired
on or after December 12, 2014, will have access to the 401(k) plan. The two contribution sources from PSE are below:
     1.  401(k) Company Matching: For non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees PSE will match: 100%
         match on the first 3.0% of pay contributed and 50.0% match on the next 3.0% of pay contributed, such that an employee who
         contributes 6.0% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match. Company matching will be immediately vested.
     Company Contribution: For UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0% of eligible pay
         placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual
         company contribution of 4.0% of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE’s Cash Balance
         retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and
         direct that PSE put the 4.0% contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
         The Company's 4.0% contribution will vest after three years of service.
(12) Retirement Benefits
     PSE has a defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Pension Benefits) covering a substantial majority of PSE employees. Pension
benefits earned are a function of age, salary, years of service and, in the case of employees in the cash balance formula plan, the
applicable annual interest crediting rates. Starting with January 1, 2014, all UA represented employees will receive annual pay
contributions of 4.0% of eligible pay each year in the cash balance formula plan of the defined benefit pension. Starting January 1,
2014, for non-represented employees, and December 12, 2014 for employees represented by the IBEW, participants will receive
annual employer contributions of 4.0% of eligible pay each year in the cash balance formula of the defined benefit pension or 401k
plan account. Those employees receiving contributions in the cash balance formula plan also receive interest credits, which are at least
1.0% per quarter. When an employee with a vested cash balance formula benefit leaves PSE, they will have annuity and lump sum
options for distribution. PSE also has a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain key senior
management employees that closed to new participants in 2019. PSE has an officer restoration benefit for new officers who join PSE
or are promoted beginning in 2019, such that company contributions under PSE’s applicable tax-qualified plan, which otherwise would
have been earned if not for IRS limitations, are credited to an account with the Deferred Compensation Plan.
     In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides legacy group health care and life insurance benefits (Other Benefits) for
certain retired employees. These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company. The insurance premiums, paid
primarily by retirees, are based on the benefits provided during the prior year. On June 11, 2019, the Welfare Benefits Committee
approved the termination of the Plan effective December 31, 2019, and the creation of a Retiree Health Reimbursement Account
(HRA) Plan effective January 1, 2020. No eligible individual may become a participant or covered dependent in the Plan on or after
January 1, 2020, and no benefits will be payable under insurance contracts or the Plan on or after January 1, 2020. Effective January 1,
2020, assets in the 401(h) account will be allocated to the Retiree HRA instead of the Plan to cover the Company's portion of
premiums for health benefits for retiree and their beneficiaries.

     in accounting for the related benefit obligation.
     The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company’s
investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these
factors. The Company’s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company’s retirement plan is
based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains (losses) measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated
value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating
market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
     The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup
Pension Liability Index Curve. The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market
interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
Plan Benefits
     The expected total benefits to be paid during the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are
as follows:

Plan Assets
     Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions
pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change. Due to uncertainties
inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to
the financial statements.
     The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance
expected return with a prudent level of risk. All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan
Committee prior to being implemented.
     The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median
long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established. Interim evaluations are
routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
     To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment
allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
                                                                                                            Allocation

Plan Fair Value Measurements
      ASC 715, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits” (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets
of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (i) how
investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and
strategies; (ii) major categories of plan assets; (iii) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (iv)
effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (v)
significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
      ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily
determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is
calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, “Financial Services – Investment Companies”. The standard requires disclosures
about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net
asset value per share.
      The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2019, and
2018:

     The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires
recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax
purposes than for financial reporting purposes. The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future
years. ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. PSE’s PTC carryforwards expire from 2033 through 2036. Net operating losses generated in 2018 and thereafter
have no expiration date. No valuation allowance has been provided for PTC or net operating loss carryforwards.

     On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation referred to as the TCJA. Substantially all of the provisions of
the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the Code), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities and
includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities including PSE. The most significant change that impacts the Company
included in the TCJA is the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% and the limitation of deductibility
of executive compensation. The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued
deductibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after December 31,
2017, and continues normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.
     Under GAAP, specifically ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period
in which the law is enacted and deferred tax assets and liabilities are to be re-measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when
temporary differences are to be realized or settled. The change in deferred taxes is recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or
liability and is subject to approval by the Washington Commission.
     Upon enactment of the TCJA, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the TCJA’s 21.0%
percent corporate federal income tax rate. The corporate tax rate change for PSE is captured in the deferred tax balance with an offset
to the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes. As a result of tax reform, the balance was a liability of $1,012.3 million. Since
PSE is in a net regulatory liability position with respect to these income tax matters, PSE netted the regulatory asset for deferred
income taxes against the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes. Under the normalization requirements continued by the TCJA,
$919.8 million of the net regulatory liability related to certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits is to be reversed over the remaining
lives of the related assets using ARAM. The remainder of the net regulatory liability of $91.9 million is available for PSE and the
Washington Commission regulatory process to determine how the amounts will be refunded to customers. PSE requested to delay the
impact of tax reform in an accounting petition which was filed with the Washington Commission on December 29, 2017. For further
details regarding PSE's ERF and Accounting Petition, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates". In 2019 and 2018, the Company reversed
excess deferred taxes for plant-related items using ARAM in the amount of $27.6 million and $29.8 million, respectively.
     The staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the
TCJA and on December 22, 2017, issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118). The guidance clarifies accounting for
income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to
complete the required analysis and accounting (the measurement period). The Company completed the required analysis and
accounting for the effects of the TCJA's enactment and did not identify any additional adjustments required.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
     The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on
technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of
last resort. Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than
50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
FERC Policy Statement
     The following disclosure is provided pursuant to the FERC Policy Statement PL 19-2-000.                      The Company records its
accumulated deferred taxes in FERC Accounts 190, 282, and 283. Based on the Company’s estimate of the amount of deferred income
taxes that would be used in setting customer rates in the future, it recorded an increase in its net regulatory liability for deferred income
taxes of approximately $1,083.8 million, resulting in a regulatory liability for deferred income taxes of $1,012.3 million in FERC
Account 254. At remeasurement, the Company did not change its regulated balances in its FERC 190, 282, or 283 Accounts.

provided in the WUTC’s order in the Company’s EFT filing. For more detail on the inclusion of excess ADIT in rates, see Footnote 3,
“Regulation and Rates”.
     As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, no interest or penalties
were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
     The Company has open tax years from 2016 through 2019. The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as
other expense in the financial statements.
(14) Litigation
     From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings relating to its operations in the
normal course of business. The following is a description of pending proceedings that are material to PSE’s operations:
Colstrip
     PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 25% interest in each of Colstrip Units 3 and 4. In March 2013,
the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners in the
U.S. District Court, District of Montana. In July 2016, PSE reached a settlement with the Sierra Club to dismiss all of the Clean Air
Act allegations against the Colstrip Generating Station, which was approved by the court in September 2016. As part of the settlement
that was signed by all Colstrip owners, Colstrip 1 and 2 owners, PSE and Talen Energy Corporation (Talen), agreed to retire the two
oldest units (Units 1 and 2) at Colstrip in eastern Montana no later than July 1, 2022. Depreciation rates were updated in the GRC
effective December 19, 2017, where PSE's depreciation increased for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 to recover plant costs to the expected
shutdown date. Additionally, PSE has accelerated the depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, per the terms of the GRC settlement, to
December 31, 2027. The GRC also repurposed PTCs and hydro-related treasury grants to recover unrecovered plant costs and to fund

and recover decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip Units 1 through 4.
      Consistent with a June 2019 announcement, Talen permanently shut down Units 1 and 2 at the end of the year due to operational
losses associated with the Units. Colstrip Units 1 and 2 were retired effective December 31, 2019. The Washington Clean Energy
Transition Act requires the Washington Commission to provide recovery of the investment, decommissioning, and remediation costs
associated with the facilities that are not recovered through the repurposed PTC's and hydro-related treasury grants. The full scope of
decommissioning activities and costs may vary from the estimates that are available at this time.
      On December 10, 2019, PSE announced its intention to sell its interest in Colstrip Unit 4 to NorthWestern Energy for $1. Under
this agreement, PSE would retain its obligation to fund 25% of the environmental remediation and decommissioning costs associated
with Unit 4 during PSE's operation. The agreement is subject to approval by the Washington Commission and the Montana Public
Service Commission. Additionally, PSE has agreed to enter into a power purchase agreement with NorthWestern Energy for 90 MW
through 2025 to facilitate the transition, and sell a portion of its dedicated Colstrip transmission system, conditioned upon regulatory
approval. PSE expects external parties to intervene on the contingent purchase agreement for Colstrip Unit 4. For accounting
purposes, management has evaluated the applicable held for sale criteria as of December 31, 2019, and determined that these criteria
were not met. As such, Unit 4 is classified as Electric Utility Plant on the balance sheet, see Note 5, "Utility Plant,".
Regional Haze Rule
      In January 2017, the EPA published revisions to the Regional Haze Rule. Among other things, these revisions delayed new
Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021, however the end date will remain 2028. In January 2018, the EPA announced that it was
reconsidering certain aspects of these revisions and PSE is unable to predict the outcome. Challenges to the 2017 Regional Haze
Revision Rule are pending in abeyance in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, pending resolution of the EPA’s
reconsideration of the rule.
Clean Air Act 111(d)/EPA Affordable clean Energy Rule
       In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to
regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants. The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to
develop plans for meeting these goals. The EPA published a final rule in October 2015. In March 2017, then EPA Administrator,
Scott Pruitt, signed a notice of withdrawal of the proposed CPP federal plan and model trading rules and, in October 2017, the EPA
proposed to repeal the CPP rule.
     In August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.. The
ACE rule was finalized in June 2019, and establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas
emissions from existing coal-fired plants. Compliance plans under ACE are due July 2020, and compliance generally required by July
2024. PSE is evaluating the final ACE rule to determine its impact on operations pending the outcome of the proposed Colstrip Unit 4
sale to NorthWestern Energy.
Washington Clean Air Rule
      The CAR was adopted in September 2016, in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from “covered
entities” located within Washington State. Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas
utilities, including PSE. The CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately
5.0% every three years. Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under
the rule, from others.
      In September 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed a lawsuit in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging the CAR. In September 2016, the four companies filed a similar
challenge to the CAR in Thurston County Superior Court. In March 2018, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR.
The Department of Ecology appealed the Superior Court decision in May 2018. As a result of the appeal, direct review to the
Washington State Supreme Court was granted and oral argument was held on March 16, 2019. In January 2020, the Washington
Supreme Court affirmed that CAR is not valid for “indirect emitters” meaning it does not apply to the sale of natural gas for use by
customers. The court ruled, however, that the rule can be severed and is valid for direct emitters including electric utilities with
permitted air emission sources, but remanded the case back to the Thurston County to determine which parts of the rule survive.
Meanwhile, the federal court litigation has been held in abeyance pending resolution of the state case.

(15) Commitments and Contingencies
     For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 10.2% of the Company’s energy output was obtained at an average cost of
approximately $0.033 per Kilowatt Hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with three of the Washington Public Utility Districts
(PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River. The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro
rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and
other expenses associated with each project, in proportion to the contractual share of power that PSE obtains from that project. In
these instances, PSE’s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments
even if power is not delivered. These projects are financed substantially through debt service payments and their annual costs should
not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance,
repairs or replacements, or license requirements. The Company’s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to
reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
     The Company's expenses under these PUD contracts were as follows for the years ended December 31, :

     The Company has entered into various firm supply, transportation and storage service contracts in order to ensure adequate
availability of natural gas supply for its customers and generation requirements. The Company contracts for its long-term natural gas
supply on a firm basis, which means the Company has a 100% daily take obligation and the supplier has a 100% daily delivery
obligation to ensure service to PSE’s customers and generation requirements. The transportation and storage contracts, which have
remaining terms from 1 year to 25 years, provide that the Company must pay a fixed demand charge each month, regardless of actual
usage. The Company incurred demand charges for 2019 for firm transportation, storage and peaking services for its natural gas
customers of $125.1 million. The Company incurred demand charges in 2019 for firm transportation and storage services for the
natural gas supply for its combustion turbines in the amount of $51.2 million.
     The following table summarizes the Company’s obligations for future natural gas supply and demand charges through the primary
terms of its existing contracts. The quantified obligations are based on the FERC and CER (Canadian Energy Regulator) currently
authorized rates, which are subject to change.

Schedule Page: 200 Line No.: 4 Column: b
The Company has adopted ASU 2016-02 as of January 1, 2019, which resulted in the recognition of right-of-use asset and
lease liabilities that have not previously been recorded and are material to the balance sheet. Under FERC Docket
AI-19-1-000, operating leases are not required to be capitalized and reported in the balance sheet accounts established for
capital leases. However, a jurisdictional entity is permitted to implement the ASU's guidance to report operating leases with
a lease term in excess of 12 months as right of use assets, with corresponding lease obligations, in the balance sheet
accounts established for capital leases. Accordingly the Company’s operating leases are recognized on the balance sheet
in Account 101.1 (Property Under Capital Leases), Account 227 (Obligations Under Capital Leases- Noncurrent), and
Account 243 (Obligations Under Capital Leases — Current). Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on
the income statement. The financial impact as of the date of adoption was not materially different than what has been
disclosed as of December 31, 2019, in Note 8, "Leases".

                                ACCUMULATED PROVISION FOR DEPRECIATION OF ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT (Account 108)
1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, Line 11, column (c), and that reported for
electric plant in service, pages 204-207, column 9d), excluding retirements of non-depreciable property.
3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when
such plant is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded
and/or classified to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book
cost of the plant retired. In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional
classifications.
4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.

The following table reflects 2019 estimated beginning and end of year balances and associated sales of
allowances held by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Because the EPA does not provide a definite
number of allowances sold upon remittance of sales proceeds, the figures below were estimated based on the
weighted average cost from months when the sales were held.

The 2010 storm deferral cost was over-amortized beginning in 2016, and the over-amortized balance was approved by WUTC Dockets
UE-170033 and UG-170034 to be applied to offset the remaining balances first on the 2006 storm deferral cost, and then any
remaining credit be applied to the 2012 storm deferral cost. This caused a credit of ($5,386,340) to reduce the 2012 storm deferral
cost. Additionally, the WUTC approved amortization of the remaining 2012 storm deferral cost over a period of 6 years, beginning in
December 2017.

$1,355,128, with a prorated amortization of $518,093 occuring in December 2017. The storm deferrals are to be amortized in order of
occurrence, beginning with the 2014 storm deferral cost.

                            RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NET INCOME WITH TAXABLE INCOME FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
1. Report the reconciliation of reported net income for the year with taxable income used in computing Federal income tax accruals and show
computation of such tax accruals. Include in the reconciliation, as far as practicable, the same detail as furnished on Schedule M-1 of the tax return for
the year. Submit a reconciliation even though there is no taxable income for the year. Indicate clearly the nature of each reconciling amount.
2. If the utility is a member of a group which files a consolidated Federal tax return, reconcile reported net income with taxable net income as if a
separate return were to be field, indicating, however, intercompany amounts to be eliminated in such a consolidated return. State names of group
member, tax assigned to each group member, and basis of allocation, assignment, or sharing of the consolidated tax among the group members.
3. A substitute page, designed to meet a particular need of a company, may be used as Long as the data is consistent and meets the requirements of
the above instructions. For electronic reporting purposes complete Line 27 and provide the substitute Page in the context of a footnote.

1. Report below for each rate schedule in effect during the year the MWH of electricity sold, revenue, average number of customer, average Kwh per
customer, and average revenue per Kwh, excluding date for Sales for Resale which is reported on Pages 310-311.
2. Provide a subheading and total for each prescribed operating revenue account in the sequence followed in "Electric Operating Revenues," Page
300-301. If the sales under any rate schedule are classified in more than one revenue account, List the rate schedule and sales data under each
applicable revenue account subheading.
3. Where the same customers are served under more than one rate schedule in the same revenue account classification (such as a general residential
schedule and an off peak water heating schedule), the entries in column (d) for the special schedule should denote the duplication in number of reported
customers.
4. The average number of customers should be the number of bills rendered during the year divided by the number of billing periods during the year (12
if all billings are made monthly).
5. For any rate schedule having a fuel adjustment clause state in a footnote the estimated additional revenue billed pursuant thereto.
6. Report amount of unbilled revenue as of end of year for each applicable revenue account subheading.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than
power exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits
for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the
supplier includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must
be the same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy
from third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the
definition of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is
one year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

                                                          SALES FOR RESALE (Account 447)
1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than
power exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits
for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the
supplier includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must
be the same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy
from third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the
definition of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is
one year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

                                                          SALES FOR RESALE (Account 447)
1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than
power exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits
for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the
supplier includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must
be the same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy
from third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the
definition of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is
one year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

OS - for other service. use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature
of the service in a footnote.
AD - for Out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. Group requirements RQ sales together and report them starting at line number one. After listing all RQ sales, enter "Subtotal - RQ"
in column (a). The remaining sales may then be listed in any order. Enter "Subtotal-Non-RQ" in column (a) after this Listing. Enter
"Total'' in column (a) as the Last Line of the schedule. Report subtotals and total for columns (9) through (k)
5. In Column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule or Tariff Number. On separate Lines, List all FERC rate schedules or tariffs under
which service, as identified in column (b), is provided.
6. For requirements RQ sales and any type of-service involving demand charges imposed on a monthly (or Longer) basis, enter the
average monthly billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP)
demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP demand is the maximum
metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during the hour (60-minute
integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must be in megawatts.
Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
7. Report in column (g) the megawatt hours shown on bills rendered to the purchaser.
8. Report demand charges in column (h), energy charges in column (i), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (j). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (j). Report in column (k)
the total charge shown on bills rendered to the purchaser.
9. The data in column (g) through (k) must be subtotaled based on the RQ/Non-RQ grouping (see instruction 4), and then totaled on
the Last -line of the schedule. The "Subtotal - RQ" amount in column (g) must be reported as Requirements Sales For Resale on Page
401, line 23. The "Subtotal - Non-RQ" amount in column (g) must be reported as Non-Requirements Sales For Resale on Page

the same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for
economic reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency
energy from third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service
which meets the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract
defined as the earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature
of the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use

RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the
supplier includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be
the same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for
economic reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency
energy from third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service
which meets the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract
defined as the earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature
of the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter
the monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the
average monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly
NCP demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand
during the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f)
must be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.

years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter
the monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the
average monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly
NCP demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand
during the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f)
must be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours

 9. Items under Cost of Plant are based on U. S. of A. Accounts. Production expenses do not include Purchased Power, System Control and Load
 Dispatching, and Other Expenses Classified as Other Power Supply Expenses. 10. For IC and GT plants, report Operating Expenses, Account Nos.
 547 and 549 on Line 25 "Electric Expenses," and Maintenance Account Nos. 553 and 554 on Line 32, "Maintenance of Electric Plant." Indicate plants
 designed for peak load service. Designate automatically operated plants. 11. For a plant equipped with combinations of fossil fuel steam, nuclear
 steam, hydro, internal combustion or gas-turbine equipment, report each as a separate plant. However, if a gas-turbine unit functions in a combined
 cycle operation with a conventional steam unit, include the gas-turbine with the steam plant. 12. If a nuclear power generating plant, briefly explain by
 footnote (a) accounting method for cost of power generated including any excess costs attributed to research and development; (b) types of cost units
 used for the various components of fuel cost; and (c) any other informative data concerning plant type fuel used, fuel enrichment type and quantity for the
 report period and other physical and operating characteristics of plant.

 9. Items under Cost of Plant are based on U. S. of A. Accounts. Production expenses do not include Purchased Power, System Control and Load
 Dispatching, and Other Expenses Classified as Other Power Supply Expenses. 10. For IC and GT plants, report Operating Expenses, Account Nos.
 547 and 549 on Line 25 "Electric Expenses," and Maintenance Account Nos. 553 and 554 on Line 32, "Maintenance of Electric Plant." Indicate plants
 designed for peak load service. Designate automatically operated plants. 11. For a plant equipped with combinations of fossil fuel steam, nuclear
 steam, hydro, internal combustion or gas-turbine equipment, report each as a separate plant. However, if a gas-turbine unit functions in a combined
 cycle operation with a conventional steam unit, include the gas-turbine with the steam plant. 12. If a nuclear power generating plant, briefly explain by
 footnote (a) accounting method for cost of power generated including any excess costs attributed to research and development; (b) types of cost units
 used for the various components of fuel cost; and (c) any other informative data concerning plant type fuel used, fuel enrichment type and quantity for the
 report period and other physical and operating characteristics of plant.

 9. Items under Cost of Plant are based on U. S. of A. Accounts. Production expenses do not include Purchased Power, System Control and Load
 Dispatching, and Other Expenses Classified as Other Power Supply Expenses. 10. For IC and GT plants, report Operating Expenses, Account Nos.
 547 and 549 on Line 25 "Electric Expenses," and Maintenance Account Nos. 553 and 554 on Line 32, "Maintenance of Electric Plant." Indicate plants
 designed for peak load service. Designate automatically operated plants. 11. For a plant equipped with combinations of fossil fuel steam, nuclear
 steam, hydro, internal combustion or gas-turbine equipment, report each as a separate plant. However, if a gas-turbine unit functions in a combined
 cycle operation with a conventional steam unit, include the gas-turbine with the steam plant. 12. If a nuclear power generating plant, briefly explain by
 footnote (a) accounting method for cost of power generated including any excess costs attributed to research and development; (b) types of cost units
 used for the various components of fuel cost; and (c) any other informative data concerning plant type fuel used, fuel enrichment type and quantity for the
 report period and other physical and operating characteristics of plant.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower;
or (4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction
by the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the
remainder of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower;
or (4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction
by the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the
remainder of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

The act of installing Shunt Reactor is to meet the requirements of Grant County as a condition to connect or intertie onto the
transmission system located at Wild Horse. This equipment serves to reduce the wind farm’s turbine impact when producing energy
during times of low load conditions in the surrounding area. This translates in allowing PSE to produce all the power it can from the
wind turbine generation system during these light load conditions but it does not (as a component) add capacity.
