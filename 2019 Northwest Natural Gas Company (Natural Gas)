        accounting words and phrases in accordance with the USofA.
 II.    Enter in whole numbers (dollars or Dth) only, except where otherwise noted. (Enter cents for averages and figures per
        unit where cents are important. The truncating of cents is allowed except on the four basic financial statements where
        rounding is required.) The amounts shown on all supporting pages must agree with the amounts entered on the

        as positive. Numbers having a sign that is different from the expected sign must be reported by enclosing the numbers in
        parentheses.
 VII.   For any resubmissions, submit the electronic filing using the form submission only. Please explain the reason for the
        resubmission in a footnote to the data field.
 VIII. Footnote and further explain accounts or pages as necessary.
 IX.    Do not make references to reports of previous periods/years or to other reports in lieu of required entries, except as
        specifically authorized.
 X.     Wherever (schedule) pages refer to figures from a previous period/year, the figures reported must be based upon those
        shown by the report of the previous period/year, or an appropriate explanation given as to why the different figures were
        used.
XI.     Report all gas volumes in Dth unless the schedule specifically requires the reporting in another unit of measurement.
                                                                 iii

           amendment and restatement of NW Natural’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”).
           The amendments to the Bylaws were made primarily to:
           Provide for the position of Vice-Chairman of the Board and specify the duties and responsibilities of such position.
           Provide that if the Board elects a Vice-Chairman of the Board, the Board shall specify in the resolution electing the Vice-

           Ms. Shawn M. Filippi, Vice President, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary, is married to a Co-Managing
           Partner of the Portland office of Stoel Rives LLP. For many years prior to Ms. Filippi's employment at NW Natural, NW
           Natural engaged the law firm Stoel Rives LLP as outside legal counsel. The Company continues to engage Stoel Rives LLP
           from time to time, and intends to do so in the future. Total fees paid to Stoel Rives LLP in 2019 were approximately
           $1,569,000. Ms. Filippi's husband is not compensated by Stoel Rives LLP based on work performed for the Company and
           does not routinely work on Company matters. Furthermore, his interest is less than 1% of Stoel Rives’ partnership allocation
           and the annual fees paid by the Company to Stoel Rives LLP in 2019 represented less than 1% of Stoel Rives LLP's annual
           gross revenues.

     11.   Increase or decrease in annual revenues caused by important rate changes:
           OREGON
           The new rates for Oregon customers reflect the Phase II of the Oregon general rate case and the annual Purchased Gas
           Adjustment (PGA). The approval of the Phase II general rate case filing took effect on April 1, 2019 that increased revenue
           of $1.4 million associated with Pension Balancing Account amortization and Tax Reform adjustment. The approval of the
           PGA went into effect on November 1, 2019 that increased the Company’s annual Oregon revenues by $15.1 million, or 2.43
           percent, passing through certain purchased gas cost adjustments, and technical adjustments amortizing the Company's
           deferred revenue and gas costs. As of June 30, 2019, 669,250 customers were affected.
           OREGON RATE CASES
           2018 General Rate Case
           On March 25, 2019, the OPUC approved the Settlement in its entirety (Pension Order).
           Under the Pension Order, the OPUC found that NW Natural properly recorded the remeasurement of regulated utility excess
           deferred income taxes pursuant to the effects of TCJA, and that all of NW Natural’s TCJA-related dockets are resolved.
           Commencing April 1, 2019, NW Natural is ordered to return excess deferred income taxes pursuant to TCJA as follows: (i) an
           annual credit to base rates of $3.4 million; (ii) a credit of $3.0 million per year for five years to sale customers; (iii) a credit to
           customers' benefit of $5.44 million of deferred income taxes, and $7.07 million of TCJA benefits deferred between January 1,
           2018 and October 31, 2018, reflected as a reduction to NW Natural’s pension balancing account, described below. As a
           result of these returns and credits, as of April 1, 2019, NW Natural’s rate base is ordered to increase by $15.38 million, and
           the revenue requirement is ordered to increase $1.43 million. If NW Natural files a general rate case within five years of the
           date of the Pension Order, this revenue requirement may be adjusted as part of that general rate case.
           As to the future operation and timing of rate recovery of amounts reflected in NW Natural’s pension balancing account, the
           Pension Order provides that, effective October 31, 2018, NW Natural would: (i) reduce the amount of the frozen pension
           balancing account by $10.5 million, and apply $12.51 million of the Company’s deferred TCJA benefits, for a total reduction
           of the pension balancing account of approximately $23.01 million; and (ii) reduce the interest rate on the pension balancing
           account from NW Natural’s authorized rate of return of 7.317 percent to 4.3 percent. NW Natural would then collect the
           remainder of the pension balancing account balance over ten years in a customer tariff of $7.3 million per year beginning on
           April 1, 2019. After giving effect to the Pension Order, NW Natural expects it will recognize a $10.5 million write-off to the
           regulatory asset relating to the pension balancing account, resulting in an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $6.7
           million in the first quarter.

                                   IMPORTANT CHANGES DURING THE YEAR (Continued)
           2020 General Rate Case
           On December 30, 2019, NW Natural filed a request for a general rate increase with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon
           (OPUC).
           The filing includes a requested $71.4 million annual revenue requirement increase based upon the following assumptions or
           requests:
                Capital structure of 50% debt and 50% equity;
                Return on equity of 10.0%;
                Cost of capital of 7.298%;
                Average rate base of $1.47 billion.
           The filing includes an increase in average rate base of $269.9 million compared to the last rate case due to the following
           items:
                Investments supporting customer growth and reliability for the distribution system as well as for operating resiliency;
                Replacing key components of our Mist storage facility, which provides service during the peak winter months; and
                Upgrading technology including cybersecurity and critical customer interfacing systems.
           NW Natural’s filing will be reviewed by the OPUC and other stakeholders. The process is anticipated to take up to 10 months
           with new rates expected to take effect November 1, 2020.
           WASHINGTON
           The new rates for the Washington general rate case, the PGA and energy efficiency filings were allowed to go into effect, by
           operation of law, for service on and after November 1, 2019 at the WUTC Open Meeting held on October 24, 2019. The PGA
           filing revised rates for changes in purchased gas costs and temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred
           accounts. The combined effects of these filings increased the Company’s annual Washington revenues by $8.3 million, or
           12.5 percent. As of June 30, 2019, 85,916 customers were affected.
           WASHINGTON RATE CASE
           2018 General Rate Case
           As previously disclosed, on December 31, 2018, Northwest Natural Gas Company (NW Natural), a wholly owned subsidiary
           of Northwest Natural Holding Company (NW Holdings), filed a general rate case in Washington. Also as previously disclosed,
           on May 23, 2019, NW Natural and other parties to the rate case proceeding filed two settlements with the Washington
           Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC); a general joint settlement agreement, and a multi-party settlement
           agreement on NW Natural’s proposed decoupling tariff. On October 21, 2019, the WUTC issued a final order approving the
           general joint settlement and rejecting the multiparty settlement on decoupling (Order).
           Under the Order, effective November 1, 2019, NW Natural is authorized to implement base rate changes designed to
           increase annual revenues from its Washington customers by approximately $5.14 million. The rate increases are based on
           the following assumptions:
                Capital structure of 50.0% long-term debt, 1.0% short-term debt, and 49.0% common equity;
                Return on equity of 9.40%;
                Cost of capital of 7.161%; and
                Rate base of $173.7 million, an increase of $46 million since the last rate case.
           The Order authorizes NW Natural to provide federal tax reform benefits to customers related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
           enacted in December 2017. The Order directs NW Natural to provide customers with a rate reduction of $2.1 million over one
           year to reflect the benefit of the lower federal corporate income tax rate accumulating from January 1, 2018 through October
           31, 2019, and provides an additional annual rate reduction initially set at approximately $0.5 million to reflect a benefit from
           the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $15.0 million.
           The Order also permits NW Natural’s recovery of environmental remediation expenses allocable to Washington customers
           for 3.32 percent of environmental remediation expense associated with remediation sites for which costs are shared between
           Oregon and Washington. The Order disallows approximately $1.5 million of deferred environmental remediation expenses,
           but permits insurance proceeds to be applied to offset deferred environmental remediation expenses of approximately $3.0
           million for a period commencing in February 2011 through November 2018 with additional application of insurance proceeds
           for a ten and one-half year period ending December 31, 2029. The order approves an environmental cost recovery
           mechanism tariff, with annual adjustments, to collect prudent environmental remediation expenditures made in the prior year,
           less that year’s allocation of insurance proceeds. NW Natural expects to recognize an after-tax charge of approximately $1.1
           million in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of this order.
     12.   Effective April 1, 2019 Thomas J. Imeson retired as Vice President of Public Affairs.
           Effective April 1, 2019 Kathryn M. Williams was appointed Vice President, Public Affairs.
           Effective May 23, 2019 C. Scott Gibson was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of NW Natural .
           Effective August 1, 2019 Lori Russell retired as Vice President of Utility Services.
           Effective August 1, 2019 David A. Weber was appointed Vice President, Gas Supply and Utility Support Services.
           Effective November 12, 2019 Monica Enand was appointed to the Board of Directors of NW Natural.

Note 2
Accounting standards allow for the capitalization of all or part of an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense if a regulator provides
orders that create probable recovery of past costs through future revenues. NW Natural Gas Company accrues interest as specified by regulatory
order on certain regulatory balances at our authorized rate of return (ROR). This ROR includes both a debt and equity component, which we are
allowed to recover from customers in the form of a carrying cost on regulatory deferred account balances. The equity component of our ROR is
not an incurred cost that would otherwise be charged to expense, and therefore is not capitalized and recognized as income for financial reporting
purposes. This leads to a difference in reported Net Income between the FERC Form 2 and the Form 10-K filed with the Securities & Exchange
Commission (SEC).

the effects of the corporate income tax rate change in 2017 on deferred tax balances that would have been "stranded" as a result of

Note 1: For 2019, Line 13.1 - Other Changes represents a reclassification from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (219) to Retained
Earnings for the effects of the corporate income tax rate change in 2017 on deferred tax balances that would have been "stranded" as a result
of remeasurement triggered by the rate change. This reclassification was done in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
2018-02. For 2018, Line 13.1 - Other Changes include non-cash dividend adjustments to the LTIP awards and immaterial round differences.
Note 2: For 2018, Line 25 - Other Changes represent the reorganization of the Company into a Holding Company structure. As part of the
reorganization, non-utility entities previously consolidated by NW Natural (i.e. Northwest Natural Gas Financing Corp.; KB Pipeline Corp.; NW
Natural Energy LLC; NW Natural Gas Storage; Gill Ranch Storage; NW Natural Water; NW Natural Holding Company) were no longer
consolidated effective October 1, 2018. As a result, unappropriated undistributed subsidiary earnings are now zero.

gross revenues or costs to which the contingency relates and the tax effects and explain the major factors that affect the rights of the utility to
retain such revenues or to recover amounts paid with respect to power and gas purchases.

the basis of allocations and apportionments from those used in the preceding year. Also give the approximate dollar effect of such changes.
13. For the 3Q disclosures, respondent must provide in the notes sufficient disclosures so as to make the interim information not misleading.
Disclosures which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the most recent FERC Annual Report may be omitted.
14. For the 3Q disclosures, the disclosures shall be provided where events subsequent to the end of the most recent year have occurred which
have a material effect on the respondent. Respondent must include in the notes significant changes since the most recently completed year in

and furnish the data required by the above instructions, such notes may be included herein.
Note: The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein appear in the annual report to shareholders as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K dated March 2, 2020. The annual report to shareholders is prepared on a
combined-basis with NW Natural’s parent company, Northwest Natural Holding Company (NW Holdings). As such, the Notes herein
may contain information relating to NW Holdings or its other subsidiaries that are not relevant to this filing and may differ in
presentation and classification, as appropriate, from FERC requirements.
FERC FORM NO. 2 (REV 12-07)                                            Page 122-1
                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
On October 1, 2018, we completed a reorganization into a holding company structure. In this reorganization, shareholders of NW
Natural (the predecessor publicly held parent company) became shareholders of NW Holdings on a one-for-one basis;
maintaining the same number of shares and ownership percentage as held in NW Natural immediately prior to the
reorganization. NW Natural became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings. Additionally, certain subsidiaries of NW Natural
were transferred to NW Holdings. This reorganization was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control.
As required under accounting guidance, these subsidiaries are presented in this report as discontinued operations in the
consolidated results of NW Natural. See Note 19 for additional information.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements represent the respective, consolidated financial results of NW Holdings and
NW Natural and all respective companies that each registrant directly or indirectly controls, either through majority ownership or
otherwise. This is a combined report of NW Holdings and NW Natural, which includes separate consolidated financial statements
for each registrant.
NW Natural's regulated natural gas distribution activities are reported in the natural gas distribution (NGD) segment. The NGD
segment is NW Natural's core operating business and serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Oregon and
southwest Washington. The NGD segment is the only reportable segment for NW Holdings and NW Natural. All other activities,
water businesses, and other investments are aggregated and reported as other at their respective registrant.
In addition, NW Holdings has reported discontinued operations results related to the pending sale of Gill Ranch Storage, LLC
(Gill Ranch). All prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change both in operational results and
reportable segments for NW Holdings and NW Natural, respectively. These reclassifications and the reorganization activities
described above had no effect on the prior year’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. See Note
19 for additional information.
NW Holdings' direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries as of the filing date of this report include:
•     Northwest Natural Gas Company (NW Natural);
      • Northwest Energy Corporation (Energy Corp);
          • NWN Gas Reserves LLC (NWN Gas Reserves);
•     NW Natural Energy, LLC (NWN Energy);
      • NW Natural Gas Storage, LLC (NWN Gas Storage);
          • Gill Ranch Storage, LLC (Gill Ranch), which is presented as a discontinued operation;
•     NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial);
      • KB Pipeline Company (KB);
•     NW Natural Water Company, LLC (NWN Water);
      • Falls Water Co., Inc. (Falls Water);
      • Salmon Valley Water Company;
      • NW Natural Water of Oregon, LLC (NWN Water of Oregon);
          • Sunstone Water, LLC;
          • Sunstone Infrastructure, LLC;
          • Sunriver Water, LLC (Sunriver Water);
          • Sunriver Environmental, LLC (Sunriver Environmental);
      • NW Natural Water of Washington, LLC (NWN Water of Washington);
          • Cascadia Water, LLC (Cascadia Water);
          • Cascadia Infrastructure, LLC;
              Suncadia Water Company, LLC (Suncadia Water);
              Suncadia Environmental Company, LLC (Suncadia Environmental);
      • NW Natural Water of Idaho, LLC (NWN Water of Idaho);
          • Gem State Water Company, LLC (Gem State Water);
          • Gem State Infrastructure, LLC; and
      • NW Natural Water of Texas, LLC (NWN Water of Texas);
          • Blue Topaz Water, LLC; and
          • Blue Topaz Infrastructure, LLC.
                                                               Page 122 A
Investments in corporate joint ventures and partnerships that NW Holdings does not directly or indirectly control, and for which it
is not the primary beneficiary, include NNG Financial's investment in Kelso-Beaver Pipeline and NWN Energy's investment in
Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH), which are accounted for under the equity method. NW Holdings and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as NW Holdings, and NW Natural and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are
collectively referred to herein as NW Natural. The consolidated financial statements of NW Holdings and NW Natural are
presented after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions.
During the second quarter of 2018, we moved forward with our long-term strategic plans, which include a shift away from the
California gas storage business. In June 2018, NWN Gas Storage, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Natural at the time and now
a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement that provides for the sale of all of the
membership interests in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gill Ranch. We received regulatory approval for the sale in December 2019.
We have concluded that the pending sale of Gill Ranch qualifies as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued
operations. As such, the results of Gill Ranch have been presented as a discontinued operation for NW Holdings for all periods
presented and for NW Natural up until the holding company reorganization was effective on October 1, 2018 on the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income and cash flows, and the assets and liabilities associated with Gill Ranch have been
classified as discontinued operations assets and liabilities on the NW Holdings consolidated balance sheet. See Note 19 for
additional information. Additionally, we reevaluated reportable segments and concluded that the remaining gas storage activities
no longer met the requirements to be separately reported as a segment. Interstate Storage Services is now reported in Other
under NW Natural and NW Holdings as applicable, and all prior periods reflect this change. See Note 4, which provides segment
information.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements reflect the activity of continuing operations for both NW Holdings and NW Natural
for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates, and changes would most likely
be reported in future periods. Management believes the estimates and assumptions used are reasonable.
Industry Regulation
NW Holdings' principal business is to operate as a holding company for NW Natural and its other subsidiaries.
NW Natural's principal business is the distribution of natural gas, which is regulated by the OPUC and WUTC. NW Natural also
has natural gas storage services, which are regulated by the FERC, and to a certain extent by the OPUC and WUTC. Additionally,
certain of NW Holdings' subsidiaries own water businesses, which are regulated by the public utility commission in the state in
which the water utility is located, which is currently Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Accounting records and practices of the
regulated businesses conform to the requirements and uniform system of accounts prescribed by these regulatory authorities in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The businesses in which customer rates are regulated by the OPUC, WUTC, IPUC, and FERC have
approved cost-based rates which are intended to allow such businesses to earn a reasonable return on invested capital.
In applying regulatory accounting principles, NW Holdings and NW Natural capitalize or defer certain costs and revenues as
regulatory assets and liabilities pursuant to orders of the applicable state public utility commission, which provide for the recovery
of revenues or expenses from, or refunds to, utility customers in future periods, including a return or a carrying charge in certain
cases.

       Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are non-cash items and, therefore, do not earn a rate of return or a carrying charge. These
       amounts are recoverable through natural gas distribution rates as part of the annual Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism when
       realized at settlement.

       Refer to the Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery table in Note 18 for a description of environmental costs.

       This deferral represents the margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes.
(4)
       Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the deferral of pension expenses.

       Balances consist of deferrals and amortizations under approved regulatory mechanisms and typically earn a rate of return or carrying charge.

       This balance represents estimated amounts associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 11.

       Estimated costs of removal on certain regulated properties are collected through rates. See "Accounting Policies—Plant, Property, and
       Accrued Asset Removal Costs" below.
The amortization period for NW Natural's regulatory assets and liabilities ranges from less than one year to an indeterminable
period. Regulatory deferrals for gas costs payable are generally amortized over 12 months beginning each November 1 following
the gas contract year during which the deferred gas costs are recorded. Similarly, most other regulatory deferred accounts are
amortized over 12 months. However, certain regulatory account balances, such as income taxes, environmental costs, pension
                                                                       Page 122 A
liabilities, and accrued asset removal costs, are large and tend to be amortized over longer periods once NW Natural has agreed
upon an amortization period with the respective regulatory agency.
We believe all costs incurred and deferred at December 31, 2019 are prudent. All regulatory assets and liabilities are reviewed
annually for recoverability, or more often if circumstances warrant. If we should determine that all or a portion of these regulatory
assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting, then NW Natural would be
required to write-off the net unrecoverable balances in the period such determination is made.
Regulatory interest income of $19.6 million and $7.6 million and regulatory interest expense of $12.3 million and $5.9 million was
recognized within other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

New Accounting Standards
NW Natural and NW Holdings consider the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates (ASUs) issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable
or are expected to have minimal impact on consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, "Income
Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income." This update was issued in response to concerns from certain stakeholders regarding the current requirements under
U.S. GAAP that deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for a change in tax laws or rates, and the effect is to be included in
income from continuing operations in the period of the enactment date. This requirement is also applicable to items in
accumulated other comprehensive income where the related tax effects were originally recognized in other comprehensive
income. The adjustment of deferred taxes due to the new corporate income tax rate enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(TCJA) on December 22, 2017 recognized in income from continuing operations causes the tax effects of items within
accumulated other comprehensive income (referred to as stranded tax effects) to not reflect the appropriate tax rate. The
amendments in this update allow but do not require a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained
earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA and require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. NW Natural
adopted and applied the standard in the first quarter of 2019. NW Natural elected to reclassify the stranded tax effects of the TCJA
of $1.4 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings in the period of adoption. Going forward, our
policy is that, in the event that regulation changes result in stranded tax effects, such amounts will be reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings in the final period that the related deferred tax balance
remeasurement is expected to impact income from continuing operations.
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. On August 28, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted
Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." The purpose of the amendment is to more closely align hedge accounting
with companies’ risk management strategies. The ASU amends the accounting for risk component hedging, the hedged item in
fair value hedges of interest rate risk, and amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The guidance also
amends the recognition and presentation of the effect of hedging instruments and includes other simplifications of hedge
accounting. The amendments in this update were effective beginning January 1, 2019 and were applied prospectively to hedging
instruments. The adoption did not have an impact on the financial statements or disclosures of NW Holdings or NW Natural.
GOODWILL. On January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The ASU
removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and under the amended guidance an entity should perform its annual goodwill
impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for
the amount in which the carrying amounts exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. The amendments in this standard are
effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests
performed after January 1, 2017. NW Natural early adopted ASU 2017-04 in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The
adoption of this ASU did not materially affect the financial statements and disclosures of NW Holdings or NW Natural.
LEASES. On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases," which revises the existing lease accounting guidance.
Pursuant to the new standard (“ASC 842”), lessees are required to recognize all leases, including operating leases that are
greater than 12 months at lease commencement, on the balance sheet and record corresponding right of use assets and lease
liabilities. Lessor accounting will remain substantially the same under the new standard. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures
are also required for users of the financial statements to have a clear understanding of the nature of our leasing activities.
We elected the alternative prospective transition approach for adoption beginning January 1, 2019. All comparative periods prior
to January 1, 2019 will retain the financial reporting and disclosure requirements of ASC 840 “Leases” (“ASC 840”). There was no
cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings recorded as of January 1, 2019 for adoption as there
were no initial direct costs or other capitalized costs related to the legacy leases that needed to be derecognized upon adoption of
ASC 842.
                                                                 Page 122 A
We elected the land easement optional practical expedient to not evaluate existing or expired land easements that were not
previously accounted for as leases under the ASC 840 lease guidance. For the existing lease portfolio, we did not elect the
optional practical expedient package to retain the legacy lease accounting conclusions upon adoption; we re-assessed our
existing contracts under the new leasing standard including whether the contract meets the definition of a lease and lease
classification. As a result, we determined that most of our underground gas storage contracts no longer meet the definition of a
lease under the new lease standard.
In October 2017, NW Natural entered into a 20-year operating lease agreement commencing in 2020 for a new corporate
operations center location in Portland, Oregon. The lease was analyzed under ASC 840 in consideration of build-to-suit lease
accounting guidance with the conclusion that NW Natural was the owner of the asset during construction for accounting purposes.
Under the new lease standard, ASC 842, NW Natural is no longer considered the owner of the asset during construction for
accounting purposes. As such, in January 2019 we derecognized the build-to-suit asset and liability balances of $26.0 million as
of December 31, 2018 that were previously recorded within property, plant and equipment and other non-current liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet.
Upon adoption on January 1, 2019, NW Holdings recorded an operating lease right of use asset and an associated operating
lease liability of approximately $7.3 million, of which $7.0 million was recorded at NW Natural. Lease liabilities are measured using
NW Natural's incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the
present value of lease payments. As of December 31, 2019, our lessee portfolio under the new standard consists primarily of our
current leased corporate operations center, which expires in 2020. Our lessor portfolio primarily consists of our North Mist Facility
which classified as a sales-type lease. See Note 7 for more information.
CLOUD COMPUTING. On August 29, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs
Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract." The purpose of the amendment is to align the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The amendments in this
update are effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, and NW Holdings and NW Natural early
adopted ASU 2018-15 in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 utilizing the prospective application methodology. The adoption of this
ASU did not materially affect the financial statements and disclosures of NW Holdings or NW Natural.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
INCOME TAXES. On December 18, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting
for Income Taxes." The purpose of the amendment is to reduce cost and complexity related to accounting for income taxes by
removing certain exceptions to the general principles and improving consistent application for other areas in Topic 740. The
amendments in this update are effective for us beginning January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The amended presentation
and disclosure guidance should be applied retrospectively. We do not expect this ASU to materially affect the financial statements
and disclosures of NW Holdings or NW Natural.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS. On August 28, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, "Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Defined Benefit Plans." The purpose of the amendment is to modify the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans. The amendments in this update are effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is
permitted. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance should be applied retrospectively. We do not expect this ASU to
materially affect the financial statements and disclosures of NW Holdings or NW Natural.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. On August 28, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, "Changes to the Disclosure Requirements
for Fair Value Measurement." The purpose of the amendment is to modify the disclosure requirements for fair value
measurements. The amendments in this update are effective for us beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The
amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used
to develop Level 3 fair value measurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied
prospectively. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively. NW Holdings and NW Natural do not have either Level 3
fair value measurements or transfers between Level 1 or Level 2 in their current portfolios, and therefore, we do not expect this
ASU to have an impact on the financial statements and disclosures of NW Holdings or NW Natural.
CREDIT LOSSES. On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,"
which applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost. The new standard will require financial
assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected and the allowance for credit losses
is to be recorded as a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The amendments in this update are
effective beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The majority
of NW Holdings' and NW Natural's financial assets are short-term in nature, such as trade receivables, and therefore, we do not
expect this ASU to materially affect our financial statements and disclosures.
                                                                 Page 122 A
Accounting Policies
The accounting policies discussed below apply to both NW Holdings and NW Natural.
Plant, Property, and Accrued Asset Removal Costs
Plant and property are stated at cost, including capitalized labor, materials, and overhead. In accordance with regulatory
accounting standards, the cost of acquiring and constructing long-lived plant and property generally includes an allowance for
funds used during construction (AFUDC) or capitalized interest. AFUDC represents the regulatory financing cost incurred when
debt and equity funds are used for construction (see “AFUDC” below). When constructed assets are subject to market-based
rates rather than cost-based rates, the financing costs incurred during construction are included in capitalized interest in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, not as regulatory financing costs under AFUDC.
In accordance with long-standing regulatory treatment, our depreciation rates consist of three components: one based on the
average service life of the asset, a second based on the estimated salvage value of the asset, and a third based on the asset’s
estimated cost of removal. We collect, through rates, the estimated cost of removal on certain regulated properties through
depreciation expense, with a corresponding offset to accumulated depreciation. These removal costs are non-legal obligations as
defined by regulatory accounting guidance. Therefore, we have included these costs as non-current regulatory liabilities rather
than as accumulated depreciation on our consolidated balance sheets. In the rate setting process, the liability for removal costs is
treated as a reduction to the net rate base on which the NGD business has the opportunity to earn its allowed rate of return.
The costs of NGD plant retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from NGD plant and charged to accumulated depreciation
for recovery or refund through future rates. Gains from the sale of regulated assets are generally deferred and refunded to
customers. For assets not related to NGD, we record a gain or loss upon the disposal of the property, and the gain or loss is
recorded in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
The provision for depreciation of NGD property, plant, and equipment is recorded under the group method on a straight-line basis
with rates computed in accordance with depreciation studies approved by regulatory authorities. The weighted-average
depreciation rate for NGD assets in service was approximately 2.9% for 2019, and 2.8% for 2018, and 2017, reflecting the
approximate weighted-average economic life of the property. This includes 2019 weighted-average depreciation rates for the
following asset categories: 2.6% for transmission and distribution plant, 2.2% for gas storage facilities, 5.7% for general plant, and
4.7% for intangible and other fixed assets.
AFUDC. Certain additions to NGD plant include AFUDC, which represents the net cost of debt and equity funds used during
construction. AFUDC is calculated using actual interest rates for debt and authorized rates for ROE, if applicable. If short-term
debt balances are less than the total balance of construction work in progress, then a composite AFUDC rate is used to represent
interest on all debt funds, shown as a reduction to interest charges, and on ROE funds, shown as other income. While cash is not
immediately recognized from recording AFUDC, it is realized in future years through rate recovery resulting from the higher NGD
cost of service. Our composite AFUDC rate was 3.9% in 2019, 5.2% in 2018, and 5.5% in 2017.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment
assessment of long-lived assets include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used, a
significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in
the observable market value or expected future cash flows of the asset, among others.
When such factors are present, we assess the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the asset will be
recovered through expected future cash flows. An asset is determined to be impaired when the carrying value of the asset
exceeds the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment is
indicated, we record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived assets.
Fair value is estimated using appropriate valuation methodologies, which may include an estimate of discounted cash flows.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, a non-cash pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets at the Gill Ranch Facility of $192.5 million was
recognized. The income approach was used to estimate fair value, using the estimated future net cash flows. We also compared
the results of the income approach to our own recent sale experience and recent market comparable transactions in order to
estimate fair value. The Gill Ranch Facility was originally included in the gas storage segment, which has since been eliminated,
and is now included in discontinued operations. We determined circumstances existed that indicated the carrying value of the
assets may not be recoverable. Those circumstances included the completion of a comprehensive strategic review process that
evaluated various alternatives including a potential sale, as well as contracting for available storage at lower than anticipated
values for the coming storage year. Given these considerations, management re-evaluated the estimated cash flows from our
interests in the Gill Ranch Facility, and determined that those estimated cash flows were no longer sufficient to cover the carrying
value of the assets. The results of Gill Ranch have been presented as a discontinued operation for NW Holdings and NW Natural
on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and cash flows, and the assets and liabilities associated with Gill Ranch
have been classified as discontinued operations assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 19 for
additional information.
                                                                Page 122 A
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand plus highly liquid investment accounts with
original maturity dates of three months or less. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Holdings had outstanding checks of
approximately $3.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively, substantially all of which is recorded at NW Natural. These balances are
included in accounts payable in the NW Holdings and NW Natural balance sheets.
Revenue Recognition and Accrued Unbilled Revenue
Revenues, derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas, are recognized upon delivery of the gas commodity or
service to customers. Revenues include accruals for gas or water delivered but not yet billed to customers based on estimates of
deliveries from meter reading dates to month end (accrued unbilled revenue). Accrued unbilled revenue is dependent upon a
number of factors that require management’s judgment, including total natural gas receipts and deliveries, customer use of natural
gas or water by billing cycle, and weather factors. Accrued unbilled revenue is reversed the following month when actual billings
occur. NW Holdings' accrued unbilled revenue at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $56.2 million and $57.8 million respectively,
substantially all of which is accrued unbilled revenue at NW Natural.
Revenues not related to NGD are derived primarily from Interstate Storage Services, asset management activities at the Mist gas
storage facility, and other investments and business activities. At the Mist underground storage facility, revenues are primarily firm
service revenues in the form of fixed monthly reservation charges. In addition, we also have asset management service revenue
from an independent energy marketing company that optimizes commodity, storage, and pipeline capacity release transactions.
Under this agreement, guaranteed asset management revenue is recognized using a straight-line, pro-rata methodology over the
term of each contract. Revenues earned above the guaranteed amount are recognized as they are earned.
Revenue Taxes
Revenue-based taxes are primarily franchise taxes, which are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. In
2018, revenue taxes are included in operating expenses in the statements of comprehensive income for NW Holdings and NW
Natural. In 2017 and 2016, revenue taxes are included in operating revenues in the statements of comprehensive income for NW
Holdings and NW Natural. All revenue taxes are recorded at NW Natural and were $30.3 million, $30.1 million, and $19.1 million
for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due for natural gas sales and transportation services to NGD customers, plus
amounts due for gas storage services. At NW Holdings and NW Natural we establish allowances for uncollectible accounts
(allowance) for trade receivables, including accrued unbilled revenue, based on the aging of receivables, collection experience of
past due account balances including payment plans, and historical trends of write-offs as a percent of revenues. A specific
allowance is established and recorded for large individual customer receivables when amounts are identified as unlikely to be
partially or fully recovered. Inactive accounts are written-off against the allowance after they are 120 days past due or when
deemed uncollectible. Differences between the estimated allowance and actual write-offs will occur based on a number of factors,
including changes in economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, and natural gas prices. The allowance for uncollectible
accounts is adjusted quarterly, as necessary, based on information currently available.
Inventories
NGD gas inventories, which consist of natural gas in storage for NGD customers, are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost
or net realizable value. The regulatory treatment of these inventories provides for cost recovery in customer rates. NGD gas
inventories injected into storage are priced in inventory based on actual purchase costs, and those withdrawn from storage are
charged to cost of gas during the period they are withdrawn at the weighted-average inventory cost.
Gas storage inventories, which primarily represent inventories at the Gill Ranch Facility and are included in Discontinued
operations - current assets on the consolidated balance sheets, mainly consist of natural gas received as fuel-in-kind from storage
customers. Gas storage inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cushion gas is not included in
inventory balances, is recorded at original cost, and is classified as a long-term plant asset.
Materials and supplies inventories consist of inventories both related to and unrelated to NGD and are stated at the lower of
average cost or net realizable value.
NW Natural's NGD and gas storage inventories totaled $27.5 million and $29.9 million at 2019 and 2018, respectively. At
December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Holdings' materials and supplies inventories, which are comprised primarily of NW Natural's
materials and supplies, totaled $16.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively.
                                                                 Page 122 A
Gas Reserves
Gas reserves are payments to acquire and produce natural gas reserves. Gas reserves are stated at cost, adjusted for regulatory
amortization, with the associated deferred tax benefits recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet. The current portion is
calculated based on expected gas deliveries within the next fiscal year. NW Natural recognizes regulatory amortization of this
asset on a volumetric basis calculated using the estimated gas reserves and the estimated therms extracted and sold each
month. The amortization of gas reserves is recorded to cost of gas along with gas production revenues and production costs. See
Note 13.
Derivatives
NW Natural's derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Changes
in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific regulatory or hedge accounting criteria are met.
Accounting for derivatives and hedges provides an exception for contracts intended for normal purchases and normal sales for
which physical delivery is probable. In addition, certain derivative contracts are approved by regulatory authorities for recovery or
refund through customer rates. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of these approved contracts are deferred as regulatory
assets or liabilities pursuant to regulatory accounting principles. NW Natural's financial derivatives generally qualify for deferral
under regulatory accounting. NW Natural's index-priced physical derivative contracts also qualify for regulatory deferral
accounting treatment.
Derivative contracts entered into for NGD requirements after the annual PGA rate has been set and maturing during the PGA year
are subject to the PGA incentive sharing mechanism. In Oregon, NW Natural participates in a PGA sharing mechanism under
which it is required to select either an 80% or 90% deferral of higher or lower gas costs such that the impact on current earnings
from the gas cost sharing is either 20% or 10% of gas cost differences compared to PGA prices, respectively. For each of the PGA
years in Oregon beginning November 1, 2019, 2018, and 2017, NW Natural selected the 90% deferral of gas cost differences. In
Washington, 100% of the differences between the PGA prices and actual gas costs are deferred. See Note 16.
NW Natural's financial derivatives policy sets forth the guidelines for using selected derivative products to support prudent risk
management strategies within designated parameters. NW Natural's objective for using derivatives is to decrease the volatility of
gas prices and cash flows without speculative risk. The use of derivatives is permitted only after the risk exposures have been
identified, are determined not to exceed acceptable tolerance levels, and are determined necessary to support normal business
activities. NW Natural does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivatives for NW Holdings are currently
held at NW Natural.
Fair Value
In accordance with fair value accounting, we use the following fair value hierarchy for determining inputs for our debt, pension
plan assets, and derivative fair value measurements:
•    Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets;
•    Level 2: Valuation is based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
     instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are
     observable in the market; and
•    Level 3: Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market.
     These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions market participants would use in valuing the
     asset or liability.
In addition, the fair value for certain pension trust investments is determined using Net Asset Value per share (NAV) as a practical
expedient, and therefore they are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments primarily consist of institutional
investment products.
When developing fair value measurements, it is our policy to use quoted market prices whenever available or to maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when quoted market prices are not available. Fair values are
primarily developed using industry-standard models that consider various inputs including: (a) quoted future prices for
commodities; (b) forward currency prices; (c) time value; (d) volatility factors; (e) current market and contractual prices for
underlying instruments; (f) market interest rates and yield curves; (g) credit spreads; and (h) other relevant economic measures.
NW Natural considers liquid points for natural gas hedging to be those points for which there are regularly published prices in a
nationally recognized publication or where the instruments are traded on an exchange.
Goodwill and Business Combinations
NW Holdings, through its wholly-owned subsidiary NWN Water and NW Water's wholly-owned subsidiaries, has completed
various acquisitions that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair
value of the consideration transferred over the acquisition-date fair value of the net identifiable assets assumed. Adjustments are
recorded during the measurement period to finalize the allocation of the purchase price. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed
annually during the fourth quarter using balances as of October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that
such carrying values may not be recoverable. The goodwill assessment policy begins with a qualitative analysis in which events
and circumstances are evaluated, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, regulatory environments,
and overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that the carrying value may be at
                                                                Page 122 A
risk of recoverability, a quantitative evaluation is performed to measure the carrying value of the goodwill against the fair value of
the reporting unit. The reporting unit is determined primarily based on current operating segments and the level of review provided
by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and/or segment management on the operating segment's financial results.
Reporting units are evaluated periodically for changes in the corporate environment.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Holdings had goodwill of $49.9 million and $9.0 million, respectively. All of NW Holdings'
goodwill was acquired in 2018 and 2019 through the business combinations completed by NWN Water and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. No impairment charges were recorded as a result of the fourth quarter goodwill impairment assessment.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate
of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the fair value of any non-controlling interest in
the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. When NW Natural acquires a business, it assesses the financial
assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms,
economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. When there is substantial judgment or uncertainty
around the fair value of acquired assets, we may engage a third party expert to assist in determining the fair values of certain
assets or liabilities.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the enactment date period unless,
for NW Natural, a regulatory order specifies deferral of the effect of the change in tax rates over a longer period of time.
For NW Natural, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also recognized for temporary differences where the deferred
income tax benefits or expenses have previously been flowed through in the ratemaking process of the NGD business.
Regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded on these deferred tax assets and liabilities to the extent it is believed they will be
recoverable from or refunded to customers in future rates.
Deferred investment tax credits on NGD plant additions, which reduce income taxes payable, are deferred for financial statement
purposes and amortized over the life of the related plant.
NW Holdings files consolidated or combined income tax returns that include NW Natural. Income tax expense is allocated on a
separate company basis incorporating certain consolidated return considerations. Subsidiary income taxes payable or receivable
are generally settled with NW Holdings, the common agent for income tax matters.
Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recognized within income tax expense and accrued interest
and penalties are recognized within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. No accrued interest or
penalties for uncertain tax benefits have been recorded. See Note 11.
Environmental Contingencies
Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is
reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies. Estimating probable losses requires an analysis
of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties. Accruals for loss contingencies are
recorded based on an analysis of potential results.
With respect to environmental liabilities and related costs, estimates are developed based on a review of information available
from numerous sources, including completed studies and site specific negotiations. NW Natural's policy is to accrue the full
amount of such liability when information is sufficient to reasonably estimate the amount of probable
liability. When information is not available to reasonably estimate the probable liability, or when only the range of
probable liabilities can be estimated and no amount within the range is more likely than another, it is our policy to accrue at the
low end of the range. Accordingly, due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the
preliminary nature of several site investigations, in some cases, it may not be possible to reasonably estimate the high end of the
range of possible loss. In those cases, the nature of the potential loss and the fact that the high end of the range cannot be
reasonably estimated is disclosed. See Note 18.
Subsequent Events
We monitor significant events occurring after the balance sheet date and prior to the issuance of the financial statements to
determine the impacts, if any, of events on the financial statements to be issued. Refer to Note 20 for our subsequent events.
                                                                 Page 122 A
3. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings or loss per share are computed using NW Holdings' net income or loss and the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for each period presented. Diluted earnings per share are computed in the same manner, except
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effects of the assumed exercise of stock options
and the payment of estimated stock awards from other stock-based compensation plans that are outstanding at the end of each
period presented. Anti-dilutive stock awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings or loss per common share.
NW Holdings' diluted earnings or loss per share are calculated as follows:

4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
We primarily operate in one reportable business segment, which is NW Natural's local gas distribution business and is referred to
as the NGD segment. During the second quarter of 2018, we moved forward with long-term strategic plans, which include a shift
away from the California gas storage business, by entering into a Purchase and Sale Agreement that provides for the sale of all
of the membership interests in Gill Ranch. As such, we reevaluated reportable segments and concluded that the remaining gas
storage activities no longer meet the requirements of a reportable segment. Interstate Storage Services and asset management
activities at the Mist gas storage facility are now reported as other under NW Natural. NW Natural and NW Holdings also have
investments and business activities not specifically related to the NGD segment, which are aggregated and reported as other
and described below for each entity.
No individual customer accounts for over 10% of NW Holdings' or NW Natural's operating revenues.
Natural Gas Distribution
NW Natural's local gas distribution segment (NGD) is a regulated utility principally engaged in the purchase, sale, and delivery of
natural gas and related services to customers in Oregon and southwest Washington. The NGD business is responsible for
building and maintaining a safe and reliable pipeline distribution system, purchasing sufficient gas supplies from producers and
marketers, contracting for firm and interruptible transportation of gas over interstate pipelines to bring gas from the supply basins
into its service territory, and re-selling the gas to customers subject to rates, terms, and conditions approved by the OPUC or
WUTC. NGD also includes taking customer-owned gas and transporting it from interstate pipeline connections, or city gates, to
the customers’ end-use facilities for a fee, which is approved by the OPUC or WUTC. Approximately 89% of NGD customers are
located in Oregon and 11% in Washington. On an annual basis, residential and commercial customers typically account for
around 60% of total NGD volumes delivered and around 90% of NGD margin. Industrial customers largely account for the
remaining volumes and NGD margin. A small amount of the margin is also derived from miscellaneous services, gains or losses
from an incentive gas cost sharing mechanism, and other service fees.
Industrial sectors served by the NGD business include: pulp, paper, and other forest products; the manufacture of electronic,
electrochemical and electrometallurgical products; the processing of farm and food products; the production of various mineral
products; metal fabrication and casting; the production of machine tools, machinery, and textiles; the manufacture of asphalt,
concrete, and rubber; printing and publishing; nurseries; and government and educational institutions.
                                                                  Page 122 A
In addition to NW Natural's local gas distribution business, the NGD segment also includes the portion of the Mist underground
storage facility used to serve NGD customers, the North Mist gas storage expansion in Oregon, and NWN Gas Reserves, which
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Corp.
NW Natural
NW Natural's activities in Other include Interstate Storage Services and third-party asset management services for the Mist
facility in Oregon, appliance retail center operations, and corporate operating and non-operating revenues and expenses that
cannot be allocated to NGD operations.
Earnings from Interstate Storage Services assets are primarily related to firm storage capacity revenues. Earnings from the Mist
facility also include revenue, net of amounts shared with NGD customers, from management of NGD assets at Mist and
upstream pipeline capacity when not needed to serve NGD customers. Under the Oregon sharing mechanism, NW Natural
retains 80% of the pre-tax income from these services when the costs of the capacity were not included in NGD rates, or 10% of
the pre-tax income when the costs have been included in these rates. The remaining 20% and 90%, respectively, are recorded to
a deferred regulatory account for crediting back to NGD customers.
NW Holdings
NW Holdings' activities in Other include all remaining activities not associated with NW Natural, specifically NWN Water, which
consolidates the water and wastewater utility operations and is pursuing other investments in the water sector through itself and
wholly-owned subsidiaries; NWN Gas Storage, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NWN Energy; NWN Energy's equity investment in
TWH, which is pursuing development of a cross-Cascades transmission pipeline project (TWP); and other pipeline assets in
NNG Financial. For more information on TWP, see Note 14. Other also includes corporate revenues and expenses that cannot
be allocated to other operations, including certain business development activities.
All prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments and the designation of
Gill Ranch as a discontinued operation for NW Holdings, and the designation of subsidiaries previously owned by NW Natural
that are now owned by NW Holdings as discontinued operations for NW Natural.
Segment Information Summary

Natural Gas Distribution Margin
NGD margin is a financial measure used by the CODM, consisting of NGD operating revenues, reduced by the associated cost
of gas, environmental remediation expense, and revenue taxes. The cost of gas purchased for NGD customers is generally a
pass-through cost in the amount of revenues billed to regulated NGD customers. Environmental remediation expense represents
collections received from customers through environmental recovery mechanisms in Oregon and Washington as well as
adjustments for the Oregon environmental earnings test when applicable. This is offset by environmental remediation expense
presented in operating expenses. Revenue taxes are collected from NGD customers and remitted to taxing authorities. The
collections from customers are offset by the expense recognition of the obligation to the taxing authority. By subtracting cost of
gas, environmental remediation expense, and revenue taxes from NGD operating revenues, NGD margin provides a key metric
used by the CODM in assessing the performance of the NGD segment.
The following table presents additional segment information concerning NGD margin:

       The change in presentation of revenue taxes was a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 "Revenue From Contracts with Customers" and
       all related amendments on January 1, 2018. This change had no impact on NGD margin results as revenue taxes were previously
       presented net in NGD operating revenue. For additional information, see Note 2.
5. COMMON STOCK
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Holdings had 100 million shares of common stock authorized. As of December 31,
2019, NW Holdings had 206,560 shares reserved for issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(ESPP) and 340,133 shares reserved for issuance under the Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRPP). At
NW Holdings' election, shares sold through the DRPP may be purchased in the open market or through original issuance of
shares reserved for issuance under the DRPP.
The Restated Stock Option Plan (SOP) was terminated with respect to new grants in 2012; however, options granted before the
Restated SOP was terminated remain outstanding until the earlier of their expiration, forfeiture, or exercise. Options are now
exercisable for shares of NW Holdings common stock. There were 10,938 options outstanding at December 31, 2019, which
were granted prior to termination of the plan.
On June 7, 2019, NW Holdings completed the issuance of 1,437,500 shares of common stock, inclusive of the overallotment
option granted to the underwriters, which was exercised in full. All shares were issued on June 7, 2019 at an offering price of
$67.00 per share. The issuance resulted in proceeds to NW Holdings of $93.0 million, net of discounts and expenses. The
issuance was executed to raise funds for general corporate purposes, including for equity contributions to NW Holdings’
subsidiaries, that are reflected as equity transfers on occurrence. Contributions received by NW Natural were also used, in part,
to repay short-term indebtedness.
Stock Repurchase Program
NW Holdings has a share repurchase program under which it may purchase its common shares on the open market or through
privately negotiated transactions. NW Holdings currently has Board authorization through May 2022 to repurchase up to an
aggregate of the greater of 2.8 million shares or $100 million. No shares of common stock were repurchased pursuant to this
program during the year ended December 31, 2019. Since the plan’s inception in 2000 under NW Natural, a total of 2.1 million
shares have been repurchased at a total cost of $83.3 million.

NW Natural's revenue represents substantially all of NW Holdings' revenue and is recognized for both registrants when the
obligation to customers is satisfied and in the amount expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing
services. Revenue from contracts with customers contains one performance obligation that is generally satisfied over time, using
the output method based on time elapsed, due to the continuous nature of the service provided. The transaction price is
determined by a set price agreed upon in the contract or dependent on regulatory tariffs. Customer accounts are settled on a
monthly basis or paid at time of sale and based on historical experience. It is probable that we will collect substantially all of the
consideration to which we are entitled.
NW Holdings and NW Natural do not have any material contract assets, as net accounts receivable and accrued unbilled
revenue balances are unconditional and only involve the passage of time until such balances are billed and collected. NW
Holdings and NW Natural do not have any material contract liabilities.
Revenue-based taxes are primarily franchise taxes, which are collected from NGD customers and remitted to taxing authorities.
Beginning January 1, 2018, revenue taxes are included in operating revenues with an equal and offsetting expense recognized
in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
Natural Gas Distribution
Natural gas sales. NW Natural's primary source of revenue is providing natural gas to customers in the NGD service territory,
which includes residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers. NGD revenue is generally recognized over time
upon delivery of the gas commodity or service to the customer, and the amount of consideration received and recognized as
revenue is dependent on the Oregon and Washington tariffs. Customer accounts are to be paid in full each month, and there is
no right of return or warranty for services provided. Revenues include firm and interruptible sales and transportation services,
franchise taxes recovered from the customer, late payment fees, service fees, and accruals for gas delivered but not yet billed
(accrued unbilled revenue). The accrued unbilled revenue balance is based on estimates of deliveries during the period from the
last meter reading and management judgment is required for a number of factors used in this calculation, including customer use
and weather factors.
We applied the significant financing practical expedient and have not adjusted the consideration NW Natural expects to receive
from NGD customers for the effects of a significant financing component as all payment arrangements are settled annually. Due
to the election of the right to invoice practical expedient, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations as
of December 31, 2019.
Alternative revenue. Weather normalization (WARM) and decoupling mechanisms are considered to be alternative revenue
programs. Alternative revenue programs are considered to be contracts between NW Natural and its regulator and are excluded
from revenue from contracts with customers.
Leasing revenue. Leasing revenue primarily consists of revenues from NW Natural's North Mist Storage contract with Portland
General Electric (PGE) in support of PGE's gas-fired electric power generation facilities under an initial 30-year contract with
options to extend, totaling up to an additional 50 years upon mutual agreement of the parties. The facility is accounted for as a
sales-type lease with regulatory accounting deferral treatment. The investment is included in rate base under an established
cost-of-service tariff schedule, with revenues recognized according to the tariff schedule and as such, profit upon
commencement was deferred and will be amortized over the lease term. Leasing revenue also contains rental revenue from
small leases of property owned by NW Natural to third parties. The majority of these transactions are accounted for as operating
leases and the revenue is recognized over the term of the lease agreement. Lease revenue is excluded from revenue from
contracts with customers. See Note 7.
NW Natural Other
Gas storage revenue. NW Natural's other revenue includes gas storage activity, which includes Mist Interstate Storage Services
used to store natural gas for customers. Gas storage revenue is generally recognized over time as the gas storage service is
provided to the customer and the amount of consideration received and recognized as revenue is dependent on set rates
defined per the storage agreements. Noncash consideration in the form of dekatherms of natural gas is received as
consideration for providing gas injection services to gas storage customers. This noncash consideration is measured at fair value
using the average spot rate. Customer accounts are generally paid in full each month, and there is no right of return or warranty
for services provided. Revenues include firm and interruptible storage services, net of the regulatory sharing amount refunded to
NGD customers.
Asset management revenue. Revenues include the optimization of the storage assets and pipeline capacity and are provided net
of the profit sharing amount refunded to NGD customers. Certain asset management revenues received are recognized over
time using a straight-line approach over the term of each contract, and the amount of consideration received and recognized as
revenue is dependent on a variable pricing model. Variable revenues earned above guaranteed amounts are estimated and
recognized at the end of each period using the most likely amount approach. Additionally, other asset management revenues
may be based on a fixed rate. Generally, asset management accounts are settled on a monthly basis.
                                                                 Page 122 A
As of December 31, 2019, unrecognized revenue for the fixed component of the transaction price related to gas storage and
asset management revenue was approximately $73.4 million. Of this amount, approximately $16.0 million will be recognized in
2020, $18.2 million in 2021, $14.5 million in 2022, $11.6 million in 2023, $7.8 million in 2024, and $5.3 million thereafter. The
amounts presented here are calculated using current contracted rates.
Appliance retail center revenue. NW Natural owns and operates an appliance store that is open to the public, where customers
can purchase natural gas home appliances. Revenue from the sale of appliances is recognized at the point in time in which the
appliance is transferred to the third party responsible for delivery and installation services and when the customer has legal title
to the appliance. It is required that the sale be paid for in full prior to transfer of legal title. The amount of consideration received
and recognized as revenue varies with changes in marketing incentives and discounts offered to customers.
NW Holdings Other
NW Holdings' primary source of other revenue is providing water and wastewater services to customers. Water distribution and
wastewater collection revenue is generally recognized over time upon delivery of the water commodity or wastewater collection
service to the customer, and the amount of consideration received and recognized as revenue is dependent on the water
customer rates set by the applicable state public utility commission and contractual rates for wastewater customers. Customer
accounts are to be paid in full each month, and there is no right of return or warranty for services provided.
We applied the significant financing practical expedient and have not adjusted the consideration we expect to receive from water
distribution and wastewater collection customers for the effects of a significant financing component as all payment
arrangements are settled annually. Due to the election of the right to invoice practical expedient, we do not disclose the value of
unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2019.
7. LEASES
Lease Revenue
Leasing revenue primarily consists of NW Natural's North Mist natural gas storage agreement with PGE which is billed under an
OPUC-approved rate schedule and includes an initial 30-year term with options to extend, totaling up to an additional 50 years
upon mutual agreement of the parties. Under U.S. GAAP, this agreement is classified as a sales-type lease and qualifies for
regulatory accounting deferral treatment. The investment in the storage facility is included in rate base under a separately
established cost-of-service tariff, with revenues recognized according to the tariff schedule. As such, the selling profit that was
calculated upon commencement as part of the sale-type lease recognition was deferred and will be amortized over the lease
term. Billing rates under the cost-of-service tariff will be updated annually to reflect current information including depreciable
asset levels, forecasted operating expenses, and the results of regulatory proceedings, as applicable, and revenue received
under this agreement is recognized as operating revenue on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There are
no variable payments or residual value guarantees. The lease does not contain an option to purchase the underlying assets.
NW Natural also maintains a sales-type lease for specialized compressor facilities to provide high pressure compressed natural
gas (CNG) services. Lease payments are outlined in an OPUC-approved rate schedule over a 10-year term. There are no
variable payments or residual value guarantees. The selling profit computed upon lease commencement was not significant.
Our lessor portfolio also contains small leases of property owned by NW Natural to third parties. These transactions are
accounted for as operating leases and the revenue is recognized over the term of the lease agreement.
The components of lease revenue at NW Natural were as follows:
                                                                                                                          Year ended

The total leases receivable above is reported under the NGD segment and the short- and long-term portions are included within
other current assets and assets under sales-type leases on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The total amount of
unguaranteed residual assets at December 31, 2019 was $4.0 million and is included in assets under sales-type leases on the
consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, under regulatory accounting, the revenues and expenses associated with these
agreements are presented on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income such that their presentation aligns with
similar regulated activities at NW Natural.
Additionally, future minimum lease payments of $0.5 million for each of the years ending 2020, 2021 and 2022 are to be received
under non-cancelable operating leases associated with non-utility property rentals. For the year ended December 31, 2019,
approximately $0.5 million of lease revenue is presented in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income as it is non-operating income.
Lease Expense
Operating Leases
We have operating leases for land, buildings and equipment. Our primary lease is for NW Natural's operations center. Our leases
have remaining lease terms of one year to 11 years. Many of our lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which
we do not include in our minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Short-term leases with a term
of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate and are entered into by NW Natural, we use NW Natural's incremental
borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease
payments.
The components of lease expense, a portion of which is capitalized, were as follows:

Finance Leases
NW Natural also leases building storage spaces for use as a gas meter room in order to provide natural gas to multifamily or
mixed use developments. These contracts are accounted for as finance leases and typically involve a one-time upfront payment
with no remaining liability. The right of use asset for finance leases was $0.5 million at December 31, 2019.
Lease Disclosures Related to Periods Prior to the First Quarter of 2019
Land, buildings, and equipment are leased under agreements that expire in various years, including a 99-year land lease that
extends through 2108. Rental costs for continuing operations were $5.9 million, $7.3 million, and $5.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, a portion of which was capitalized.

8. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation plans are designed to promote stock ownership in NW Holdings by employees and officers of NW
Holdings and its affiliates. These compensation plans include a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), an ESPP, and a Restated SOP.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP is intended to provide a flexible, competitive compensation program for eligible officers and key employees. Under the
LTIP, shares of NW Holdings common stock are authorized for equity incentive grants in the form of stock, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, stock options, or performance shares. An aggregate of 1,100,000 shares were authorized for issuance as
of December 31, 2019. Shares awarded under the LTIP may be purchased on the open market or issued as original shares.
Of the 1,100,000 shares of common stock authorized for LTIP awards at December 31, 2019, there were 510,931 shares
available for issuance under any type of award. This assumes market, performance, and service-based grants currently
outstanding are awarded at the target level. There were no outstanding grants of restricted stock or stock options under the LTIP
at December 31, 2019 or 2018. The LTIP stock awards are compensatory awards for which compensation expense is based on
the fair value of stock awards, with expense being recognized over the performance and vesting period of the outstanding
awards. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
Performance Shares
LTIP performance shares incorporate a combination of market, performance, and service-based factors. The following table
summarizes performance share expense information:

      In addition to common stock shares, a participant also receives a dividend equivalent cash payment equal to the number of shares of
      common stock received on the award payout multiplied by the aggregate cash dividends paid per share during the performance period.

For the 2017-2019 performance period, performance share awards are based on the achievement of EPS and Return on
Invested Capital (ROIC) factors, which can be modified by a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) factor relative to the performance of
the Russell 2500 Utilities Index over the three-year performance period and a growth modifier based on accumulative EBITDA.
For the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 performance period, performance share awards are based on the achievement of a three-
year ROIC threshold that must be met and a cumulative EPS factor, which can be modified by a TSR factor relative to the
performance of the Russell 2500 Utilities Index over the three-year performance period. The 2018-2020 and 2019-2021
performance period allows for one of the performance factors to remain variable until the first quarter of the third year of the
award period. As the performance factor will not be approved until the first quarter of 2020 and 2021, there is not a mutual
understanding of the awards' key terms and conditions between NW Natural and the participants as of December 31, 2019, and
therefore, no expense was recognized for the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 performance period. NW Natural will calculate the grant
date fair value and recognize expense once the final performance factor has been approved. If the target is achieved for the
2018-2020 and 2019-2021 awards, NW Holdings would grant 31,825 and 35,170 shares in the first quarter of 2020 and 2021,
respectively.
Compensation expense is recognized in accordance with accounting standards for stock-based compensation and calculated
based on performance levels achieved and an estimated fair value using the Monte-Carlo method. Due to there not being a
mutual understanding of the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 awards' key terms and conditions as noted above, the grant date fair
value has not yet been determined and no nonvested shares existed at December 31, 2019. The weighted-average grant date
fair value of nonvested shares associated with the 2017-2019 awards was $57.05 per share at December 31, 2018. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of shares vested during the year was $57.05 per share and there were no performance
shares granted during the year and no unrecognized compensation expense for accounting purposes as of December 31, 2019.
Restricted Stock Units
In 2012, RSUs began being granted under the LTIP instead of stock options under the Restated SOP. Generally, the RSUs
awarded are forfeitable and include a performance-based threshold as well as a vesting period of four years from the grant
date. Upon vesting, the RSU holder is issued one share of common stock plus a cash payment equal to the total amount of
dividends paid per share between the grant date and vesting date of that portion of the RSU. The fair value of an RSU is equal to
the closing market price of NW Holdings' common stock on the grant date. During 2019, total RSU expense was $1.8 million
compared to $1.8 million in 2018 and $1.6 million in 2017. As of December 31, 2019, there was $3.4 million of unrecognized
compensation cost from grants of RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a period extending through 2024.
Information regarding the RSU activity is summarized as follows:

Restated Stock Option Plan
The NW Natural Restated SOP was terminated for new option grants in 2012; however, options granted before the plan
terminated remain outstanding until the earlier of their expiration, forfeiture, or exercise and are now exercisable for shares of
NW Holdings common stock. Any new grants of stock options will be made under NW Holdings' LTIP, however, no option grants
have been awarded since 2012 and all stock options were vested as of December 31, 2015.
Options under the Restated SOP were granted to officers and key employees designated by a committee of the Board of
Directors. All options were granted at an option price equal to the closing market price on the date of grant and may be exercised
for a period of up to 10 years and seven days from the date of grant. Option holders may exchange shares they have owned for
at least six months, valued at the current market price, to purchase shares at the option price.

9. DEBT
Short-Term Debt
The primary source of short-term liquidity for NW Holdings is cash balances, dividends from its operating subsidiaries, in
particular NW Natural, available cash from a multi-year credit facility, and short-term credit facilities it may enter into from time to
time.
The primary source of short-term liquidity for NW Natural is from the sale of commercial paper, its multi-year credit facilities, and
short-term credit facilities it may enter into from time to time. In addition to issuing commercial paper or bank loans to meet
working capital requirements, including seasonal requirements to finance gas purchases and accounts receivable, short-term
debt may also be used to temporarily fund capital requirements. For NW Natural, commercial paper and bank loans are
periodically refinanced through the sale of long-term debt or equity contributions from NW Holdings. NW Natural's commercial
paper is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement and is supported by one or more
unsecured revolving credit facilities. See “Credit Agreements” below.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Holdings had short-term debt outstanding of $149.1 million and $217.6 million,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate of NW Holdings' short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018
was 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Natural had $125.1 million and $217.5 million of
commercial paper outstanding, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of commercial paper outstanding at
December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively.
                                                                  Page 122 A
The carrying cost of commercial paper approximates fair value using Level 2 inputs. See Note 2 for a description of the fair value
hierarchy. At December 31, 2019, NW Natural's commercial paper had a maximum remaining maturity of 22 days and an
average remaining maturity of 10 days.
Credit Agreements
NW Holdings
In October 2018, NW Holdings entered into a $100.0 million credit agreement, with a feature that allows it to request increases in
the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $150.0 million. The maturity date of the agreement is October 2, 2023, with
available extensions of commitments for two additional one-year periods, subject to lender approval.
The NW Holdings credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $40.0 million. The
principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement is due and payable on the maturity date. The credit agreement
requires NW Holdings to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with
this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts
outstanding. NW Holdings was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The agreement also requires NW Holdings to maintain debt ratings (which are defined by a formula using NW Natural's credit
ratings in the event NW Holdings does not have a credit rating) with Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. (Moody’s) and notify the lenders of any change in its senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt ratings, as
applicable, by such rating agencies. A change in NW Holdings' debt ratings by S&P or Moody’s is not an event of default, nor is
the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement. Rather, interest
rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreements are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating
would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreements when ratings are changed. NW Holdings does not
currently maintain ratings with S&P or Moody's.
There was a $24.0 million outstanding balance and no outstanding balances under the NW Holdings agreement at
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No letters of credit were issued or outstanding under the NW Holdings agreement at
December 31, 2019 and 2018. NW Holdings had $1.0 million and $2.8 million of letters of credit issued and outstanding in
support of acquisitions of water companies, separate from the aforementioned credit agreement, at December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively.
NW Natural
In October 2018, NW Natural entered into a new multi-year credit agreement for unsecured revolving loans totaling $300.0
million, with a feature that allows NW Natural to request increases in the total commitment amount, up to a maximum of $450.0
million. The maturity date of the agreement is October 2, 2023 with available extensions of commitments for two additional one-
year periods, subject to lender approval. The new credit agreement is substantially similar to the prior credit agreement which
was terminated upon the closing of the New Credit Agreement. The new credit agreement permits the issuance of letters of
credit in an aggregate amount of up to $60.0 million. The principal amount of borrowings under the credit agreement is due and
payable on the maturity date. There were no outstanding balances under NW Natural's prior credit agreement or the new credit
agreement and no letters of credit issued or outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
NW Natural's prior credit agreement and the new credit agreement require NW Natural to maintain a consolidated indebtedness
to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending
commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Natural was in compliance with this covenant at
December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The new credit agreement also requires NW Natural to maintain credit ratings with S&P and Moody’s and notify the lenders of
any change in NW Natural's senior unsecured debt ratings or senior secured debt ratings, as applicable, by such rating
agencies. A change in NW Natural's debt ratings by S&P or Moody’s is not an event of default, nor is the maintenance of a
specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the new credit agreement. Rather, interest rates on any loans
outstanding under the new credit agreement are tied to debt ratings and therefore, a change in the debt rating would increase or
decrease the cost of any loans under the new credit agreement when ratings are changed.

Long-Term Debt
NW Holdings
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, NW Holdings had long-term debt outstanding of $881.1 million and $736.2 million,
respectively; which included $5.7 million and $5.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs at NW Natural, respectively. NW
Holdings' long-term debt is primarily comprised of debt held at its wholly-owned subsidiaries NW Natural (shown below) and
NWN Water. Long-term debt at NWN Water is primarily comprised of a two-year term loan agreement for $35.0 million, due in
2021. NWN Water entered into this agreement in June 2019 and the loan carried an interest rate of 2.35% at December 31,
2019, which is based upon the one-month LIBOR rate. The loan is guaranteed by NW Holdings and requires NW Holdings to
maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of 70% or less. Failure to comply with this covenant would
entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding. NW Holdings
was in compliance with this covenant at December 31, 2019, with a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of
54.3%.
NW Natural
NW Natural's issuance of FMBs, which includes NW Natural's medium-term notes, under the Mortgage and Deed of Trust
(Mortgage) is limited by eligible property, adjusted net earnings, and other provisions of the Mortgage. The Mortgage constitutes
a first mortgage lien on substantially all of NW Natural's NGD property.

Fair Value of Long-Term Debt
NW Holdings' and NW Natural's outstanding debt does not trade in active markets. The fair value of debt is estimated using
natural gas distribution companies with similar credit ratings, terms, and remaining maturities to NW Holdings' and NW Natural's
debt that actively trade in public markets. Substantially all outstanding debt at NW Holdings is comprised of NW Natural debt.
These valuations are based on Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 2.

10. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS
NW Natural maintains a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan), non-qualified supplemental
pension plans for eligible executive officers and other key employees, and other postretirement employee benefit plans. NW
Natural also has a qualified defined contribution plan (Retirement K Savings Plan) for all eligible employees. The Pension Plan
and Retirement K Savings Plan have plan assets, which are held in qualified trusts to fund retirement benefits.

employees and union employees, respectively, were closed to new participants.
Non-union and union employees hired or re-hired after December 31, 2006 and 2009, respectively, and employees of NW
Natural subsidiaries are provided an enhanced Retirement K Savings Plan benefit.

    Reclassification of $1.4 million of income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings
was made pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2018-02. See Note 2.
In 2020, NW Natural will amortize an estimated $18.3 million from regulatory assets to net periodic benefit costs, consisting of
$18.8 million of actuarial losses offset by $0.5 million of prior service credits. A total of $0.9 million will be amortized from AOCL
to earnings related to actuarial losses in 2020.
The assumed discount rates for NW Natural's Pension Plan and other postretirement benefit plans were determined
independently based on the FTSE Above Median Curve (discount rate curve), which uses high quality corporate bonds rated AA-
or higher by S&P or Aa3 or higher by Moody’s. The discount rate curve was applied to match the estimated cash flows in each of
the plans to reflect the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments for these plans.
The assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Pension Plan was developed using a weighted-average of
the expected returns for the target asset portfolio. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, consideration
was given to the historical performance of each asset class in which the plan’s assets are invested and the target asset
allocation for plan assets.
The investment strategy and policies for Pension Plan assets held in the retirement trust fund were approved by the NW Natural
Retirement Committee, which is composed of senior management with the assistance of an outside investment consultant. The
policies set forth the guidelines and objectives governing the investment of plan assets. Plan assets are invested for total return
with appropriate consideration for liquidity, portfolio risk, and return expectations. All investments are expected to satisfy the
prudent investments rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The approved asset classes may include
cash and short-term investments, fixed income, common stock and convertible securities, absolute and real return strategies,
and real estate. Plan assets may be invested in separately managed accounts or in commingled or mutual funds. Investment re-
balancing takes place periodically as needed, or when significant cash flows occur, in order to maintain the allocation of assets
within the stated target ranges. The retirement trust fund is not currently invested in NW Holdings or NW Natural securities.

Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan obligations were $38.3 million and $35.4 million at December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively. These plans are not subject to regulatory deferral, and the changes in actuarial gains and losses, prior
service costs, and transition assets or obligations are recognized in AOCL, net of tax until they are amortized as a component of
net periodic benefit cost. These are unfunded, non-qualified plans with no plan assets; however, a significant portion of the
obligations is indirectly funded with company and trust-owned life insurance and other assets.
                                                                         Page 122 A
Other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded plans but are subject to regulatory deferral. The actuarial gains and losses, prior
service costs, and transition assets or obligations for these plans are recognized as a regulatory asset.
Net periodic benefit costs consist of service costs, interest costs, the expected returns on plan assets, and the amortization of
gains and losses and prior service costs. The gains and losses are the sum of the actuarial and asset gains and losses
throughout the year and are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants. The asset gains and
losses are based in part on a market-related valuation of assets. The market-related valuation reflects differences between
expected returns and actual investment returns with the differences recognized over a two-year period from the year in which
they occur, thereby reducing year-to-year net periodic benefit cost volatility.
The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for NW Natural pension and other postretirement benefit plans is
recognized in operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The other non-
service cost components are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
income. The following table provides the components of net periodic benefit cost for NW Natural's pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31:

Net periodic benefit costs are reduced by amounts capitalized to NGD plant. In addition, a certain amount of net periodic benefit
costs were recorded to the regulatory balancing account, representing net periodic pension expense for the Pension Plan above
the amount set in rates, as approved by the OPUC, from 2011 through October 31, 2018.
In March 2019, the OPUC issued an order concluding the NW Natural 2018 Oregon rate case. The order allowed for the
application of certain deferred revenues and tax benefits from the TCJA to reduce NW Natural's pension regulatory balancing
account. A corresponding total of $12.5 million in pension expenses were recognized in operating and maintenance expense and
other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the first quarter of 2019, with offsetting
benefits recorded within operating revenues and income taxes. The order also directed NW Natural to reduce the balancing
account by an additional $10.5 million, of which $3.9 million was charged to operations and maintenance expense and $6.6
million was charged to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Amortization of the
remaining amount of the balancing account began in the second quarter of 2019 in accordance with the order.
Total amortization of the regulatory balancing account of $16.8 million in 2019, of which $6.2 million was charged to operations
and maintenance expense and $10.6 million was charged to other income (expense), net. Total deferrals of the regulatory
balancing account were $10.3 million in 2018, of which $2.4 million was deferred from operations and maintenance expense and
$7.9 million was deferred from other income (expense), net.

The following table provides the assumptions used in measuring periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations for the years
ended December 31:

(1)
   Rate assumption is 6.50% in 2020 and 3.50% thereafter. The 2020 compensation increase assumption was a result of the 2019 execution of a
new collective bargaining agreement with unionized members of NW Natural effective December 1, 2019.
The assumed annual increase in health care cost trend rates used in measuring other postretirement benefits as of
December 31, 2019 was 6.50%. These trend rates apply to both medical and prescription drugs. Medical costs and prescription
drugs are assumed to decrease gradually each year to a rate of 4.75% by 2026.
Assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans; however,
other postretirement benefit plans have a cap on the amount of costs reimbursable by NW Natural.
A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Mortality assumptions are reviewed annually and are updated for material changes as necessary. In 2019, mortality rate
assumptions were updated from RP-2014 mortality tables using scale MP-2018 to Pri-2012 mortality tables using scale
MP-2019, which partially offset increases of the projected benefit obligation.

Employer Contributions to Company-Sponsored Defined Benefit Pension Plans
NW Natural makes contributions to its qualified defined benefit Pension Plans based on actuarial assumptions and estimates, tax
regulations, and funding requirements under federal law. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) established funding
requirements for defined benefit plans. The Act establishes a 100% funding target over seven years for plan years beginning
after December 31, 2008. In July 2012, President Obama signed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act
                                                                   Page 122 A
(MAP-21) into law, which changed several provisions affecting pension plans, including temporary funding relief and Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) premium increases, which shifts the level of minimum required contributions from the
short-term to the long-term as well as increasing the operational costs of running a pension plan. MAP-21 established a new
minimum and maximum corridor for segment rates based on a 25-year average of bond yields, which resulted in lower minimum
contributions requirements than those under previous regulations. MAP-21, as amended, provides for the current corridor to be
in effect through 2020 and subsequently broaden on an annual basis from 2021 through 2024.
The Pension Plan was underfunded by $164.3 million at December 31, 2019. NW Natural made cash contributions totaling $11.0
million to its Pension Plan for 2019. During 2020, NW Natural expects to make contributions of approximately $29.0 million to
this plan.
Multiemployer Pension Plan
In addition to the NW Natural-sponsored Pension Plan presented above, prior to 2014 NW Natural contributed to a
multiemployer pension plan for its NGD union employees known as the Western States Office and Professional Employees
International Union Pension Fund (Western States Plan). That plan's employer identification number is 94-6076144. Effective
December 22, 2013, NW Natural withdrew from the plan, which was a noncash transaction. Vested participants will receive all
benefits accrued through the date of withdrawal. As the plan was underfunded at the time of withdrawal, NW Natural was
assessed a withdrawal liability of $8.3 million, plus interest, which requires NW Natural to pay $0.6 million each year to the plan
for 20 years beginning in July 2014. The cost of the withdrawal liability was deferred to a regulatory account on the balance
sheet.
Payments were $0.6 million for 2019, and as of December 31, 2019 the liability balance was $6.5 million. Contributions to the
plan were $0.6 million for each of 2018 and 2017, which was approximately 5% to 6% of the total contributions to the plan by all
employer participants in those years.
Defined Contribution Plan
NW Natural's Retirement K Savings Plan is a qualified defined contribution plan under Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(a)
and 401(k). NW Natural contributions totaled $7.0 million, $6.5 million, and $5.4 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
The Retirement K Savings Plan includes an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
Deferred Compensation Plans
NW Natural's supplemental deferred compensation plans for eligible officers and senior managers are non-qualified plans. These
plans are designed to enhance the retirement savings of employees and to assist them in strengthening their financial security
by providing an incentive to save and invest regularly.
Fair Value
Below is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. In cases where NW Natural's
Pension Plan is invested through a collective trust fund or mutual fund, the fund's market value is utilized. Market values for
investments directly owned are also utilized.
U.S. EQUITY. These are non-published net asset value (NAV) assets. The non-published NAV assets consist of commingled trusts
where NAV is not published but the investment can be readily disposed of at NAV or market value. The underlying investments in
this asset class includes investments primarily in U.S. common stocks.
INTERNATIONAL/GLOBAL EQUITY. These are Level 1 and non-published NAV assets. The Level 1 asset is a mutual fund, and the
non-published NAV assets consist of commingled trusts where the NAV/unit price is not published, but the investment can be
readily disposed of at the NAV/unit price. The mutual funds has a readily determinable fair value, including a published NAV, and
the commingled trusts are valued at unit price. This asset class includes investments primarily in foreign equity common stocks.
LIABILITY HEDGING. These are non-published NAV assets. The non-published NAV assets consist of commingled trusts where
NAV is not published but the investment can be readily disposed of at NAV or market value. The underlying investments in this
asset class include long duration fixed income investments primarily in U.S. treasuries, U.S. government agencies, municipal
securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, as well as U.S. and international investment-grade corporate
bonds.
OPPORTUNISTIC. These are non-published NAV assets consisting of commingled trusts where the investments can be readily
disposed of at unit price, and a hedge fund of funds where the valuation is not published. This hedge fund of funds is winding
down. Based on recent dispositions, NW Natural believes the remaining investment is fairly valued. The hedge fund of funds is
valued at the weighted average value of investments in various hedge funds, which in turn are valued at the closing price of the
underlying securities. This asset class includes investments in emerging market debt, leveraged loans, REITs, high yield bonds,
a commodities fund, and a hedge fund of funds.
                                                                 Page 122 A
ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGY. This is a non-published NAV asset consisting of a hedge fund of funds where the valuation is not
published. This hedge fund of funds is winding down. Based on recent dispositions, NW Natural believes the remaining
investment is fairly valued. The hedge fund of funds is valued at the weighted average value of investments in various hedge
funds, which in turn are valued at the closing price of the underlying securities. This asset class primarily includes investments in
common stocks and fixed income securities.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. These are Level 1 and non-published NAV assets. The Level 1 assets consist of cash in U.S.
dollars, which can be readily disposed of at face value. The non-published NAV assets represent mutual funds without published
NAV's but the investment can be readily disposed of at the NAV. The mutual funds are valued at the NAV of the shares held by
the plan at the valuation date.
The preceding valuation methods may produce a fair value calculation that is not indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future fair values. Although we believe these valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain investments could result in a different fair
value measurement at the reporting date.
Investment securities are exposed to various financial risks including interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of
risk associated with certain investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of NW Natural's investment
securities will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect NW Natural's investment account balances and
the amounts reported as plan assets available for benefit payments.
The following tables present the fair value of NW Natural's plan assets, including outstanding receivables and liabilities, of NW
Natural's retirement trust fund:

            The fair value for these investments is determined using Net Asset Value per share (NAV) as of December 31, as a practical expedient,
            and therefore they are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. These investments primarily consist of institutional investment
            products, for which the NAV is generally not publicly available.

The NW Holdings and NW Natural effective income tax rates for 2019 compared to 2018 changed primarily as a result of lower
pre-tax income and amortization of excess deferred income tax benefits as ordered by regulatory commissions. The NW
Holdings and NW Natural effective income tax rates for 2018 compared to 2017 changed primarily as a result of the lower
federal corporate income tax rate provided for by the TCJA.
The provision for current and deferred income taxes consists of the following at December 31:

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, regulatory income tax assets of $16.9 million and $19.1 million, respectively, were recorded by
NW Natural, a portion of which is recorded in current assets. These regulatory income tax assets primarily represent future rate
recovery of deferred tax liabilities, resulting from differences in NGD plant financial statement and tax bases and NGD plant
removal costs, which were previously flowed through for rate making purposes and to take into account the additional future
taxes, which will be generated by that recovery. These deferred tax liabilities, and the associated regulatory income tax assets,
are currently being recovered through customer rates. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, regulatory income tax assets of $2.5
million and $2.3 million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural, representing future recovery of deferred tax liabilities
resulting from the equity portion of AFUDC.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, deferred tax assets of $54.3 million and $57.5 million, respectively, were recorded by NW
Natural representing the future income tax benefit associated with the excess deferred income tax regulatory liability recorded as
a result of the lower federal corporate income tax rate provided for by the TCJA. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, regulatory
liability balances representing the benefit of the change in deferred taxes as a result of the TCJA of $205.0 million and $217.1
million, respectively, were recorded by NW Natural.
NW Natural’s natural gas utility rates include an allowance to provide for the recovery of the anticipated provision for income
taxes incurred as a result of providing regulated services. As a result of the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate enacted
in 2017, NW Natural recorded an additional regulatory liability in 2018 and 2019 reflecting the deferral of the estimated rate
benefit for customers. The deferral period for Oregon ended on October 31, 2018 coincident with new rates beginning November
1, 2018. The deferral period for Washington ended on October 31, 2019 coincident with new rates beginning November 1, 2019.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, a regulatory liability of $1.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, was recorded to reflect this
estimated revenue deferral.
NW Holdings and NW Natural assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient taxable income will be
generated to utilize their respective existing deferred tax assets. Based upon this assessment, NW Holdings and NW Natural
determined that it is more likely than not that all of their respective deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2019 will be
realized.
The Company estimates it has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $0.4 million for federal taxes and $0.4 million for
Oregon taxes at December 31, 2019. We anticipate fully utilizing these NOL carryforward balances before they begin to expire in
2027 for federal and 2022 for Oregon. California alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits of $0.1 million are also available. The
AMT credits do not expire.
Uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that require an assessment of the anticipated
settlement outcome of material uncertain tax positions taken in a prior year, or planned to be taken in the current year. Until such
positions are sustained, the uncertain tax benefits resulting from such positions would not be recognized. No reserves for
uncertain tax positions were recorded as of December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.
The federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 and earlier are closed by statute. The IRS Compliance Assurance Process
(CAP) examination of the 2016 and 2017 tax years have been completed. There were no material changes to these returns as
filed. The 2018 and 2019 tax years are currently under IRS CAP examination. Our 2020 CAP application has been filed. Under
the CAP program, NW Holdings and NW Natural work with the IRS to identify and resolve material tax matters before the tax
return is filed each year.
As of December 31, 2019, income tax years 2015 through 2018 remain open for examination by the State of California. Income
tax year 2018 is open for examination by the State of Idaho. The State of Oregon examined the Oregon corporate income tax
returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. No material changes occurred as a result of this examination.
U.S. Federal TCJA Matters
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and permanently lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from
the previous maximum rate of 35%, effective for the tax year beginning January 1, 2018. The TCJA included specific provisions
related to regulated public utilities that provide for the continued deductibility of interest expense and the elimination of bonus tax
depreciation for property both acquired and placed into service on or after January 1, 2018.
Under pre-TCJA law, business interest was generally deductible in the determination of taxable income. The TCJA imposed a
new limitation on the deductibility of net business interest expense in excess of approximately 30 percent of adjusted taxable
income. Taxpayers operating in the trade or business of a regulated utility are excluded from these new interest expense
limitations. Proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations were published in November of 2018 which provide a de minimis rule whereby if
90 percent or more of a taxpayer's adjusted asset basis is allocable to regulated utility activities, then all of the business interest
expense of that taxpayer is deemed to be excepted business interest of the regulated utility activity and is thereby not limited
under the TCJA. As a result of the de minimis rule, NW Holdings and NW Natural anticipate that business interest expense will
not be limited under the TCJA.
                                                                  Page 122 A
The TCJA generally provides for immediate full expensing for qualified property both acquired and placed in service after
September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023. This would generally provide for accelerated cost recovery for capital
investments. However, the definition of qualified property excludes property used in the trade or business of a regulated utility.
Final U.S. Treasury Regulations were published in September of 2019 which clarified that bonus tax depreciation would not be
available for regulated utility activity assets both acquired and placed in service by NW Holdings or NW Natural on or after
January 1, 2018. Proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations released in September of 2019 indicated that long production period
property acquired before September 27, 2017 continues to qualify for bonus depreciation in the year placed in service consistent
with pre-TCJA law.
The SEC staff previously issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the
TCJA. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the TCJA enactment date for
companies to complete the accounting for the TCJA under ASC 740. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain
income tax effects of the TCJA was incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be made, a company would record a provisional
estimate in the financial statements. NW Natural previously disclosed that due to uncertainties with respect to the availability of
bonus tax depreciation for regulated utility activity assets under the TCJA that the effects of bonus tax depreciation for assets
placed in service after September 27, 2017 but before January 1, 2018 had not been recorded. The determination to exclude all
assets placed in service after September 27, 2017 but before January 1, 2018 from bonus tax depreciation was provisional as
provided for under SAB 118.
As a result of the Proposed Regulations on bonus tax depreciation published in August of 2018, NW Natural revised the
provisional estimate of deferred taxes and income taxes payable to reflect the effects of bonus tax depreciation for assets placed
in service after September 27, 2017 but before January 1, 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, NW Natural recognized increases to
prepaid income tax of $7.4 million, deferred income tax liability of $4.1 million, and regulatory liability of $3.3 million. In the fourth
quarter of 2018, NW Natural recognized additional increases to prepaid income tax of $0.5 million, deferred income tax liability of
$0.3 million, and regulatory liability of $0.2 million. The accounting for income tax effects of the TCJA was complete at the end of
calendar year 2018.
NW Natural previously filed applications with the OPUC and WUTC to defer the NGD net income tax benefits resulting from the
TCJA. In March 2019, the OPUC issued an order addressing the regulatory amortization of the income tax benefits from the
TCJA that NW Natural deferred for Oregon customers in December of 2017. Under the order, NW Natural will provide the benefit
of these TCJA income tax deferrals to Oregon customers through ongoing annual credits to customer base rates and as a one-
time recovery of a portion of the pension balancing account regulatory asset balance. On an annualized basis, it is anticipated
that the income tax benefits from the provision of these TCJA benefits to customers should approximate the reduction to pretax
income that occurs as a result of the customer base rate credits and one-time recovery of a portion of the pension balancing
account.
In October 2019, the WUTC issued an order addressing the regulatory amortization of the income tax benefits from the TCJA
that NW Natural deferred for Washington customers in December of 2017. Under the order, NW Natural will provide deferred
income tax benefits from the TCJA to customers through base rate credits beginning November 1, 2019.

      NW Natural previously reported other balances which were restated due to certain assets and liabilities now being classified as
      discontinued operations assets and liabilities in its balance sheets. See Note 19 for further discussion.
Accumulated depreciation does not include the accumulated provision for asset removal costs of $401.9 million and $380.5
million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These accrued asset removal costs are reflected on the balance sheet as
regulatory liabilities. See Note 2. During 2019 and 2018, no equipment was acquired under capital leases.
NW Holdings
Other plant balances include long-lived assets associated with water operations and non-regulated activities not held by NW
Natural or its subsidiaries.
NW Natural
Other plant balances include long-lived assets not related to NGD and long-lived assets that may be used to support NGD
operations.
The weighted average depreciation rate for NGD assets was 2.9% during 2019 and 2.8% during 2018, and 2017. The weighted
average depreciation rate for assets not related to NGD was 1.8% in 2019, 2.2% in 2018, and 1.9% in 2017.
In October 2017, NW Natural entered into a 20-year lease agreement expected to commence in 2020 for its new corporate
operations center location in Portland, Oregon. Under the new lease standard, NW Natural is no longer considered the
accounting owner of the asset during construction. As such, the build to suit asset and liability balances at December 31, 2018 of
$26.0 million were derecognized in January 2019. The previous build to suit balances were recorded under ASC 840 within
property, plant and equipment and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
In May 2019, NW Natural placed its North Mist gas storage expansion facility into service and commenced storage services to
the facility's single customer, PGE. Under U.S. GAAP, this agreement is classified as a sales-type lease and qualifies for
regulatory accounting deferral treatment. Accordingly, the project was de-recognized from property, plant and equipment upon
lease commencement and the investment balance is presented net of the current portion of scheduled billings within assets
under sales-type leases on the consolidated balance sheets. A total of $146.0 million was de-recognized from plant on the lease
commencement date. The facility is included within rate base for ratemaking purposes. See Note 7 for information regarding
leases, including North Mist.
                                                                       Page 122 A
   13. GAS RESERVES
   NW Natural has invested $188 million through the gas reserves program in the Jonah Field located in Wyoming as of
   December 31, 2019. Gas reserves are stated at cost, net of regulatory amortization, with the associated deferred tax benefits
   recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The investment in gas reserves provides long-term price protection
   for NGD customers through the original agreement with Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. under which NW Natural invested $178
   million and the amended agreement with Jonah Energy LLC under which an additional $10 million was invested.
   NW Natural entered into the original agreements with Encana in 2011 under which NW Natural holds working interests in
   certain sections of the Jonah Field. Gas produced in these sections is sold at prevailing market prices, and revenues from such
   sales, net of associated operating and production costs and amortization, are credited to the NGD cost of gas. The cost of gas,
   including a carrying cost for the rate base investment, is included in the annual Oregon PGA filing, which allows NW Natural to
   recover these costs through customer rates. The investment under the original agreement, less accumulated amortization and
   deferred taxes, earns a rate of return.
   In March 2014, NW Natural amended the original gas reserves agreement in order to facilitate Encana's proposed sale of its
   interest in the Jonah field to Jonah Energy. Under the amendment, NW Natural ended the drilling program with Encana, but
   increased its working interests in its assigned sections of the Jonah field. NW Natural also retained the right to invest in new
   wells with Jonah Energy. Under the amended agreement there is still the option to invest in additional wells on a well-by-well
   basis with drilling costs and resulting gas volumes shared at NW Natural's amended proportionate working interest for each well
   in which it invests. NW Natural elected to participate in some of the additional wells drilled in 2014, but has not participated in
   additional wells since 2014. However, there may be the opportunity to participate in more wells in the future.
   Gas produced from the additional wells is included in the Oregon PGA at a fixed rate of $0.4725 per therm, which approximates
   the 10-year hedge rate plus financing costs at the inception of the investment.
   Gas reserves acted to hedge the cost of gas for approximately 5%, 6%, and 6% of NGD gas supplies for the years ended
   December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.
   The following table outlines NW Natural's net gas reserves investment at December 31:

Investment in Life Insurance Policies
NW Natural has invested in key person life insurance contracts to provide an indirect funding vehicle for certain long-term
employee and director benefit plan liabilities. The amount in the above table is reported at cash surrender value, net of policy
loans.
                                                                          Page 122 A
Investments in Gas Pipeline
Trail West Pipeline, LLC (TWP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TWH, is pursuing the development of a new gas transmission
pipeline that would provide an interconnection with NW Natural's NGD system. NWN Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW
Holdings, owns 50% of TWH, and 50% is owned by TransCanada American Investments Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of TransCanada Corporation.
Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Analysis
TWH is a VIE, with NW Holdings' investment in TWP reported under equity method accounting. It has been determined that NW
Holdings is not the primary beneficiary of TWH’s activities as it only has a 50% share of the entity, and there are no stipulations
that allow NW Holdings a disproportionate influence over it. Investments in TWH and TWP are included in other investments on
NW Holdings' balance sheet. If this investment is not developed, then the maximum loss exposure related to TWH is limited to
NW Holdings' equity investment balance, less its share of any cash or other assets available to NW Holdings as a 50% owner.
The investment balance in TWH was $13.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Impairment Analysis
Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment at each reporting
period and following updates to our corporate planning assumptions. If it is determined a loss in value is other than temporary, a
charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. Fair value is based
on quoted market prices when available or on the present value of expected future cash flows. Differing assumptions could affect
the timing and amount of a charge recorded in any period.
In 2011, TWP withdrew its original application with the FERC for a proposed natural gas pipeline in Oregon and informed FERC
that it intended to re-file an application to reflect changes in the project scope aligning the project with the region’s current and
future gas infrastructure needs. TWP continues working with customers in the Pacific Northwest to further understand their gas
transportation needs and determine the commercial support for a revised pipeline proposal. A new FERC certificate application is
expected to be filed to reflect a revised scope based on these regional needs.
NW Holdings' equity investment was not impaired at December 31, 2019 as the fair value of expected cash flows from planned
development exceeded NW Holdings' remaining equity investment of $13.4 million at December 31, 2019. However, if NW
Holdings learns that the project is not viable or will not go forward, it could be required to recognize a maximum charge of up to
approximately $13.4 million based on the current amount of the equity investment, net of cash and working capital at TWP. NW
Holdings will continue to monitor and update the impairment analysis as required.
15. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
2019 Business Combinations
Sunriver
On May 31, 2019, NWN Water of Oregon, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of NW Holdings, completed the acquisition of
Sunriver Water and Sunriver Environmental (collectively referred to as Sunriver), a privately-owned water utility and wastewater
treatment company located in Sunriver, Oregon that serves approximately 9,400 connections. The acquisition-date fair value of
the total consideration transferred, after closing adjustments, was approximately $55.0 million in cash consideration. The
transaction aligns with NW Holdings' water sector strategy as it continues to expand its water utility service territory in the Pacific
Northwest and begins to pursue wastewater investment opportunities.
The Sunriver acquisition met the criteria of a business combination, and as such a preliminary allocation of the consideration to
the acquired assets based on their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date was performed. In accordance with U.S. GAAP,
the fair value determination was made using existing regulatory conditions for assets associated with Sunriver Water, LLC as
well as existing market conditions and standard valuation approaches for assets associated with Sunriver Environmental, LLC in
order to allocate value as determined by an independent third party assessor for certain assets, which involved the use of
management judgment in determining the significant estimates and assumptions used by the assessor, with the remaining
difference from the consideration transferred being recorded as goodwill. This allocation is considered preliminary as of
December 31, 2019, as facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date may be discovered as we continue to
integrate Sunriver. As a result, subsequent adjustments to the preliminary valuation of tangible assets, contract assets and
liabilities, tax positions, and goodwill may be required. Subsequent adjustments are not expected to be significant, and any such
adjustments are expected to be completed within the one-year measurement period. The acquisition costs were expensed as
incurred.
Preliminary goodwill of $40.1 million was recognized from this acquisition. The goodwill recognized is attributable to Sunriver's
regulated water utility service territory, experienced workforce, and the strategic benefits for both the water utility and wastewater
services expected from growth in its service territory. No intangible assets aside from goodwill were acquired. The total amount
of goodwill that is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes is approximately $50.2 million.
                                                                  Page 122 A

The amount of Sunriver revenues included in NW Holdings' consolidated statements of comprehensive income is $3.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. Earnings from Sunriver activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were not material
to the results of NW Holdings.
Other Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2019, NWN Water completed three additional acquisitions qualifying as business
combinations. The aggregate fair value of the preliminary consideration transferred for these acquisitions was approximately
$2.0 million. These business combinations were not significant to NW Holdings' results of operations.
2018 Business Combinations
Falls Water
On September 13, 2018, NWN Water, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Natural and now a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW
Holdings, completed the acquisition of Falls Water, a privately-owned water utility in the Pacific Northwest for non-cash
consideration of $8.5 million, in the form of 125,000 shares of NW Natural common stock, which were converted to NW Holdings
common stock in our October 1, 2018 reorganization. Falls Water became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NWN Water and marked
its first acquisition in the water utility sector. This acquisition aligns with NW Holdings' water sector strategy as the acquisition
provides NWN Water entry into Idaho, expands service area, and opens further opportunity for growth. Falls Water is based in
Idaho Falls, Idaho and served approximately 5,300 connections at the time of acquisition.
Through the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of Falls Water, NWN Water acquired the net assets and 100% control of
Falls Water. We determined that the Falls Water acquisition met the criteria of a business combination, and as such performed
an allocation of the consideration to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair value as of the acquisition
date, the majority of which was allocated to goodwill. The acquisition costs were insignificant and were expensed as incurred.
The results of Falls Water are not material to the consolidated financial results of NW Holdings.
Goodwill of $6.2 million was recognized from this acquisition and is attributable to Falls Water's regulated service territory and
experienced workforce as well as the strategic benefits expected from this high-growth service territory. NW Holdings has
included this goodwill in other for segment reporting purposes, and it is not deductible for income tax purposes. No intangible
assets aside from goodwill were acquired. See Note 2 for goodwill impairment information.
Other Acquisitions
During 2018, in addition to the Falls Water acquisition, NWN Water completed three acquisitions qualifying as business
combinations. The aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred for these acquisitions was approximately $2.8 million.
These business combinations, both individually and in aggregate, were not significant to NW Holdings' results of operations.
As a result of all acquisitions completed, total goodwill was $49.9 million and $9.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively. The increase in the goodwill balance was due to additions associated with our acquisitions in the water sector. All of
our goodwill is related to water and wastewater acquisitions and is included in the other category for segment reporting
purposes. The annual impairment assessment of goodwill occurs in the fourth quarter of each year. There have been no
impairments recognized to date.
                                                                    Page 122 A
16. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
NW Natural enters into financial derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the NGD segment’s natural gas sales requirements.
These contracts include swaps, options, and combinations of option contracts. These derivative financial instruments are
primarily used to manage commodity price variability. A small portion of NW Natural's derivative hedging strategy involves foreign
currency exchange contracts.
NW Natural enters into these financial derivatives, up to prescribed limits, primarily to hedge price variability related to physical
gas supply contracts as well as to hedge spot purchases of natural gas. The foreign currency forward contracts are used to
hedge the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates for pipeline demand charges paid in Canadian dollars.
In the normal course of business, NW Natural also enters into indexed-price physical forward natural gas commodity purchase
contracts and options to meet the requirements of NGD customers. These contracts qualify for regulatory deferral accounting
treatment.
NW Natural also enters into exchange contracts related to the third-party asset management of its gas portfolio, some of which
are derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory deferral, but are subject to NW Natural's regulatory sharing
agreement. These derivatives are recognized in operating revenues, net of amounts shared with NGD customers.

Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA)
Derivatives entered into by NW Natural for the procurement or hedging of natural gas for future gas years generally receive
regulatory deferral accounting treatment. In general, commodity hedging for the current gas year is completed prior to the start of
the gas year, and hedge prices are reflected in the weighted-average cost of gas in the PGA filing. Rates and hedging
approaches may vary between states due to different rate structures and mechanisms. In addition, as required with the
Washington PGA filing, NW Natural incorporated and began implementing risk-responsive hedging strategies for the 2019-20
PGA for its Washington gas supplies. Hedge contracts entered into after the start of the PGA period are subject to the PGA
incentive sharing mechanism in Oregon. NW Natural entered the 2019-20 and 2018-19 gas years with forecasted sales volumes
hedged at 52% and 48% in financial swap and option contracts, and 19% and 24% in physical gas supplies, respectively. Hedge
contracts entered into prior to the PGA filing, in September 2019, were included in the PGA for the 2019-20 gas year. Hedge
contracts entered into after the PGA filing, and related to subsequent gas years, may be included in future PGA filings and qualify
for regulatory deferral.

Unrealized Gain/Loss
Outstanding derivative instruments related to regulated NGD operations are deferred in accordance with regulatory accounting
standards. The cost of foreign currency forward and natural gas derivative contracts are recognized immediately in the cost of
gas; however, costs above or below the amount embedded in the current year PGA are subject to a regulatory deferral tariff and
therefore, are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.
                                                               Page 122 A
Realized Gain/Loss
NW Natural realized net gains of $17.9 million and net gains of $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, from the settlement of natural gas financial derivative contracts. Realized gains and losses offset the higher or lower
cost of gas purchased, resulting in no incremental amounts to collect or refund to customers.
Credit Risk Management of Financial Derivatives Instruments
No collateral was posted with or by NW Natural counterparties as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. NW Natural attempts to
minimize the potential exposure to collateral calls by diversifying counterparties to manage liquidity risk. Counterparties generally
allow a certain credit limit threshold before requiring NW Natural to post collateral against loss positions. Given NW Natural's
counterparty credit limits and portfolio diversification, it was not subject to collateral calls in 2019 or 2018. The collateral call
exposure is set forth under credit support agreements, which generally contain credit limits. NW Natural could also be subject to
collateral call exposure where it has agreed to provide adequate assurance, which is not specific as to the amount of credit limit
allowed, but could potentially require additional collateral in the event of a material adverse change.
Based upon current commodity financial swap and option contracts outstanding, which reflect unrealized gains of $5.6 million at
December 31, 2019, we have estimated the level of collateral demands, with and without potential adequate assurance calls,
using current gas prices and various credit downgrade rating scenarios for NW Natural as follows:
                                                                                          Credit Rating Downgrade Scenarios

NW Natural's financial derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements; however, they are presented on a
gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets. NW Natural and its counterparties have the ability to set-off obligations to each
other under specified circumstances. Such circumstances may include a defaulting party, a credit change due to a merger
affecting either party, or any other termination event.
If netted by counterparty, NW Natural's physical and financial derivative position would result in an asset of $9.4 million and a
liability of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2019, and an asset of $3.6 million and a liability of $9.3 million as of December 31,
2018.
NW Natural is exposed to derivative credit and liquidity risk primarily through securing fixed price natural gas commodity swaps
with financial counterparties. NW Natural utilizes master netting arrangements through International Swaps and Derivatives
Association contracts to minimize this risk along with collateral support agreements with counterparties based on their credit
ratings. In certain cases, NW Natural requires guarantees or letters of credit from counterparties to meet its minimum credit
requirement standards.
NW Natural's financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have an investment-grade credit rating at the time the
derivative instrument is entered into, and specifies limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty’s
credit rating. NW Natural does not speculate with derivatives. Derivatives are used to hedge exposure above risk tolerance
limits. Increases in market risk created by the use of derivatives is offset by the exposures they modify.
We actively monitor NW Natural's derivative credit exposure and place counterparties on hold for trading purposes or require
other forms of credit assurance, such as letters of credit, cash collateral, or guarantees as circumstances warrant. The ongoing
assessment of counterparty credit risk includes consideration of credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, bond market credit
spreads, financial condition, government actions, and market news. A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to estimate the
change in credit and liquidity risk from the volatility of natural gas prices. The results of the model are used to establish trading
limits. NW Natural's outstanding financial derivatives at December 31, 2019 mature by October 31, 2022.
We could become materially exposed to credit risk with one or more of our counterparties if natural gas prices experience a
significant increase. If a counterparty were to become insolvent or fail to perform on its obligations, we could suffer a material
loss; however, we would expect such a loss to be eligible for regulatory deferral and rate recovery, subject to a prudence review.
All of our existing counterparties currently have investment-grade credit ratings.
Fair Value
In accordance with fair value accounting, NW natural includes non-performance risk in calculating fair value adjustments. This
includes a credit risk adjustment based on the credit spreads of NW Natural counterparties when in an unrealized gain position,
or on NW Natural's own credit spread when it is in an unrealized loss position. The inputs in our valuation models include natural
gas futures, volatility, credit default swap spreads, and interest rates. Additionally, the assessment of non-performance risk is
generally derived from the credit default swap market and from bond market credit spreads. The impact of the credit risk
adjustments for all outstanding derivatives was immaterial to the fair value calculation at December 31, 2019. As of
                                                                   Page 122 A
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the net fair value was an asset of $7.5 million and a liability of $5.7 million, respectively, using
significant other observable, or Level 2, inputs. No Level 3 inputs were used in our derivative valuations, and there were no
transfers between Level 1 or Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Gas Purchase and Pipeline Capacity Purchase and Release Commitments
NW Natural has signed agreements providing for the reservation of firm pipeline capacity under which it is required to make fixed
monthly payments for contracted capacity. The pricing component of the monthly payment is established, subject to change, by
U.S. or Canadian regulatory bodies, or is established directly with private counterparties, as applicable. In addition, NW Natural
has entered into long-term agreements to release firm pipeline capacity. NW Natural also enters into short-term and long-term
gas purchase agreements.
The aggregate amounts of these agreements were as follows at December 31, 2019:
                                                                                                      Pipeline             Pipeline

18. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NW Natural owns, or previously owned, properties that may require environmental remediation or action. The range of loss for
environmental liabilities is estimated based on current remediation technology, enacted laws and regulations, industry
experience gained at similar sites, and an assessment of the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other
potentially responsible parties (PRPs). When amounts are prudently expended related to site remediation of those sites
described herein, NW Natural has recovery mechanisms in place to collect 96.68% of remediation costs allocable to Oregon
customers and 3.32% of costs allocable to Washington customers.
These sites are subject to the remediation process prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Oregon
Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The process begins with a remedial investigation (RI) to determine the nature and
extent of contamination and then a risk assessment (RA) to establish whether the contamination at the site poses unacceptable
risks to humans and the environment. Next, a feasibility study (FS) or an engineering evaluation/cost analysis (EE/CA) evaluates
various remedial alternatives. It is at this point in the process when NW Natural is able to estimate a range of remediation costs
and record a reasonable potential remediation liability, or make an adjustment to the existing liability. From this study, the
regulatory agency selects a remedy and issues a Record of Decision (ROD). After a ROD is issued, NW Natural would seek to
negotiate a consent decree or consent judgment for designing and implementing the remedy. NW Natural would have the ability
to further refine estimates of remediation liabilities at that time.
                                                                  Page 122 A
Remediation may include treatment of contaminated media such as sediment, soil and groundwater, removal and disposal of
media, institutional controls such as legal restrictions on future property use, or natural recovery. Following construction of the
remedy, the EPA and ODEQ also have requirements for ongoing maintenance, monitoring and other post-remediation care that
may continue for many years. Where appropriate and reasonably known, NW Natural will provide for these costs in the
remediation liabilities described below.
Due to the numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of several
site investigations, in some cases, NW Natural may not be able to reasonably estimate the high end of the range of possible
loss. In those cases, the nature of the possible loss has been disclosed, as has the fact that the high end of the range cannot be
reasonably estimated where a range of potential loss is available. Unless there is an estimate within the range of possible losses
that is more likely than other cost estimates within that range, NW Natural records the liability at the low end of this range. It is
likely changes in these estimates and ranges will occur throughout the remediation process for each of these sites due to the
continued evaluation and clarification concerning responsibility, the complexity of environmental laws and regulations and the
determination by regulators of remediation alternatives. In addition to remediation costs, NW Natural could also be subject to
Natural Resource Damages (NRD) claims. NW Natural will assess the likelihood and probability of each claim and recognize a
liability if deemed appropriate. Refer to "Other Portland Harbor" below.

Portland Harbor Site
The Portland Harbor is an EPA listed Superfund site that is approximately 10 miles long on the Willamette River and is adjacent
to NW Natural's Gasco uplands site. NW Natural is one of over one hundred PRPs to the Superfund site. In January 2017, the
EPA issued its Record of Decision, which selects the remedy for the clean-up of the Portland Harbor site (Portland Harbor ROD).
The Portland Harbor ROD estimates the present value total cost at approximately $1.05 billion with an accuracy between -30%
and +50% of actual costs.
NW Natural's potential liability is a portion of the costs of the remedy for the entire Portland Harbor Superfund site. The cost of
that remedy is expected to be allocated among more than one hundred PRPs. NW Natural is participating in a non-binding
allocation process with the other PRPs in an effort to resolve its potential liability. The Portland Harbor ROD does not provide any
additional clarification around allocation of costs among PRPs; accordingly, NW Natural has not modified any of the recorded
liabilities at this time as a result of the issuance of the Portland Harbor ROD.
NW Natural manages its liability related to the Superfund site as two distinct remediation projects, the Gasco/Siltronic Sediments
and Other Portland Harbor projects.
Gasco/Siltronic Sediments. In 2009, NW Natural and Siltronic Corporation entered into a separate Administrative Order on
Consent with the EPA to evaluate and design specific remedies for sediments adjacent to the Gasco uplands and Siltronic
uplands sites. NW Natural submitted a draft EE/CA to the EPA in May 2012 to provide the estimated cost of potential remedial
alternatives for this site. In February 2020, NW Natural and the EPA reached an agreement to amend the Administrative Order
on Consent to include additional remedial design activities for sediment investigation costs adjacent to the Gasco uplands. At this
time, the estimated costs for the various sediment remedy alternatives in the draft EE/CA for the additional studies and design
work needed before the cleanup can occur, and for regulatory oversight throughout the cleanup range from $57.7 million to $350
million. NW Natural has recorded a liability of $57.7 million for the sediment clean-up, which reflects the low end of the range. At
this time, we believe sediments at this site represent the largest portion of NW Natural's liability related to the Portland Harbor
site discussed above.
                                                                   Page 122 A
Other Portland Harbor. While we believe liabilities associated with the Gasco/Siltronic sediments site represent NW Natural's
largest exposure, there are other potential exposures associated with the Portland Harbor ROD, including NRD costs and
harborwide remedial design and cleanup costs (including downstream petroleum contamination), for which allocations among
the PRPs have not yet been determined.
NW Natural and other parties have signed a cooperative agreement with the Portland Harbor Natural Resource Trustee council
to participate in a phased NRD assessment to estimate liabilities to support an early restoration-based settlement of NRD
claims. One member of this Trustee council, the Yakama Nation, withdrew from the council in 2009, and in 2017, filed suit
against NW Natural and 29 other parties seeking remedial costs and NRD assessment costs associated with the Portland
Harbor site, set forth in the complaint. The complaint seeks recovery of alleged costs totaling $0.3 million in connection with the
selection of a remedial action for the Portland Harbor site as well as declaratory judgment for unspecified future remedial action
costs and for costs to assess the injury, loss or destruction of natural resources resulting from the release of hazardous
substances at and from the Portland Harbor site. The Yakama Nation has filed two amended complaints addressing certain
pleading defects and dismissing the State of Oregon. On the motion of NW Natural and certain other defendants the federal
court has stayed the case pending the outcome of the non-binding allocation proceeding discussed above. NW Natural has
recorded a liability for NRD claims which is at the low end of the range of the potential liability; the high end of the range cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time. The NRD liability is not included in the aforementioned range of costs provided in the
Portland Harbor ROD.
Gasco Uplands Site
A predecessor of NW Natural, Portland Gas and Coke Company, owned a former gas manufacturing plant that was closed in
1958 (Gasco site) and is adjacent to the Portland Harbor site described above. The Gasco site has been under investigation by
NW Natural for environmental contamination under the ODEQ Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP). It is not included in the range
of remedial costs for the Portland Harbor site noted above. The Gasco site is managed in two parts, the uplands portion and the
groundwater source control action.
NW Natural submitted a revised Remedial Investigation Report for the uplands to ODEQ in May 2007. In March 2015, ODEQ
approved Remedial Assessment (RA) for this site, enabling commencement of work on the FS in 2016. NW Natural has
recognized a liability for the remediation of the uplands portion of the site which is at the low end of the range of potential liability;
the high end of the range cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
In October 2016, ODEQ and NW Natural agreed to amend their VCP agreement to incorporate a portion of the Siltronic property
adjacent to the Gasco site formerly owned by Portland Gas & Coke between 1939 and 1960 into the Gasco RA and FS,
excluding the uplands for Siltronic. Previously, NW Natural was conducting an investigation of manufactured gas plant
constituents on the entire Siltronic uplands for ODEQ. Siltronic will be working with ODEQ directly on environmental impacts to
the remainder of its property.
In September 2013, NW Natural completed construction of a groundwater source control system, including a water treatment
station, at the Gasco site. NW Natural has estimated the cost associated with the ongoing operation of the system and has
recognized a liability which is at the low end of the range of potential cost. NW Natural cannot estimate the high end of the range
at this time due to the uncertainty associated with the duration of running the water treatment station, which is highly dependent
on the remedy determined for both the upland portion as well as the final remedy for Gasco sediment exposure.
Other Sites
In addition to those sites above, NW Natural has environmental exposures at three other sites: Central Service Center, Front
Street and Oregon Steel Mills. NW Natural may have exposure at other sites that have not been identified at this time. Due to the
uncertainty of the design of remediation, regulation, timing of the remediation and in the case of the Oregon Steel Mills site,
pending litigation, liabilities for each of these sites have been recognized at their respective low end of the range of potential
liability; the high end of the range could not be reasonably estimated at this time.
Central Service Center site. The investigative phase to characterize the existing site has been completed and determined by the
Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to be sufficient to allow for the issuance of a Conditional No Further Action
(cNFA). The Company is now conducting ongoing environmental monitoring activities over the next 5 years in order to meet the
conditions which were included within the cNFA.
Front Street site. The Front Street site was the former location of a gas manufacturing plant NW Natural operated (the former
Portland Gas Manufacturing site, or PGM). At ODEQ’s request, NW Natural conducted a sediment and source control
investigation and provided findings to ODEQ. In December 2015, an FS on the former Portland Gas Manufacturing site was
completed.
In July 2017, ODEQ issued the PGM ROD. The ROD specifies the selected remedy, which requires a combination of dredging,
capping, treatment, and natural recovery. In addition, the selected remedy also requires institutional controls and long-term
inspection and maintenance. NW Natural revised the liability in the second quarter of 2017 to incorporate the estimated
undiscounted cost of approximately $10.5 million for the selected remedy. Further, NW Natural has recognized an additional
                                                                 Page 122 A
liability of $0.3 million for additional studies and design costs as well as regulatory oversight throughout the cleanup. NW Natural
plans to construct the remedy in 2020.
Oregon Steel Mills site. Refer to the “Legal Proceedings,” below.
Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery
NW Natural has authorizations in Oregon and Washington to defer costs related to remediation of properties that are owned or
were previously owned by NW Natural. In Oregon, a Site Remediation and Recovery Mechanism (SRRM) is currently in place to
recover prudently incurred costs allocable to Oregon customers, subject to an earnings test. On October 21, 2019 the WUTC
authorized an Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism (ECRM) for recovery of prudently incurred costs allocable to
Washington customers beginning November 1, 2019.

      Includes pre-review and post-review deferred costs, amounts currently in amortization, and interest, net of amounts collected from
      customers. In Oregon, NW Natural earns a carrying charge on cash amounts paid, whereas amounts accrued but not yet paid do not earn a
      carrying charge until expended. NW Natural also accrues a carrying charge on insurance proceeds for amounts owed to customers. In
      Washington, neither the cash paid nor insurance proceeds accrue a carrying charge.

      Excludes 3.32% of the Front Street site liability, or $0.4 million in 2019 and $0.4 million in 2018, as the OPUC only allows recovery of
      96.68% of costs for those sites allocable to Oregon, including those that historically served only Oregon customers.
(3)
      Amounts included in this estimate are still subject to a prudence review by the OPUC and WUTC, and earnings test review by the OPUC.
      Amounts do not include the $5.0 million tariff rider. See "Oregon SRRM" below.
Oregon SRRM
COLLECTIONS FROM OREGON CUSTOMERS. Under the SRRM collection process there are three types of deferred
environmental remediation expense:
•     Pre-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has not yet been deemed prudent by the OPUC.
      Carrying costs on these remediation expenses are recorded at NW Natural's authorized cost of capital. NW Natural
      anticipates the prudence review for annual costs and approval of the earnings test prescribed by the OPUC to occur by the
      third quarter of the following year.
•     Post-review - This class of costs represents remediation spend that has been deemed prudent and allowed after applying
      the earnings test, but is not yet included in amortization. NW Natural earns a carrying cost on these amounts at a rate equal
      to the five-year treasury rate plus 100 basis points.
•     Amortization - This class of costs represents amounts included in current customer rates for collection and is generally
      calculated as one-fifth of the post-review deferred balance. NW Natural earns a carrying cost equal to the amortization rate
      determined annually by the OPUC, which approximates a short-term borrowing rate.
In addition to the collection amount noted above, an order issued by the OPUC provides for the annual collection of $5.0 million
from Oregon customers through a tariff rider. As NW Natural collects amounts from customers, it recognizes these collections as
revenue and separately amortizes an equal and offsetting amount of its deferred regulatory asset balance through the
environmental remediation operating expense line shown separately in the operating expense section of the income statement.
NW Natural received total environmental insurance proceeds of approximately $150 million as a result of settlements from
litigation that was dismissed in July 2014. Under a 2015 OPUC order which established the SRRM, one-third of the Oregon
allocated proceeds were applied to costs deferred through 2012 with the remaining two-thirds applied to costs at a rate of $5.0
million per year plus interest over the following 20 years. NW Natural accrues interest on the Oregon allocated insurance
proceeds in the customer’s favor at a rate equal to the five-year treasury rate plus 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2019,
NW Natural has applied $78.2 million of insurance proceeds to prudently incurred remediation costs allocated to Oregon.
OREGON ENVIRONMENTAL EARNINGS TEST. To the extent NW Natural earns at or below its authorized Return on Equity
(ROE), remediation expenses and interest in excess of the $5.0 million tariff rider and $5.0 million insurance proceeds are
recoverable through the SRRM. To the extent NW Natural earns more than its authorized ROE in a year, it is required to cover
environmental expenses and interest on expenses greater than the $10.0 million with those earnings that exceed its authorized
ROE.
                                                                          Page 122 A
Washington ECRM
WASHINGTON DEFERRAL. On October 21, 2019 the WUTC issued an order (WUTC Order) establishing the ECRM which
allows for recovery of past deferred and future prudently incurred environmental remediation costs allocable to Washington
customers through application of insurance proceeds and collections from customers. Environmental remediation expenses
relating to sites that previously served both Oregon and Washington customers are allocated between states with Washington
customers receiving 3.32% percent of the costs and insurance proceeds.
As a result of the WUTC Order, in the fourth quarter of 2019 approximately $3.0 million of prudently incurred costs deferred from
the initial deferral authorization in February 2011 through November 2018 were fully offset with insurance proceeds. In addition,
approximately $1.5 million of disallowed deferred environmental remediation expenses incurred prior to the deferral authorization
were charged to environmental remediation expense.
Insurance proceeds will be fully applied to costs incurred between December 2018 and June 2019 once deemed prudent in
future rate proceedings. Remaining insurance proceeds will be amortized over a 10.5 year period ending December 31, 2029.
On an annual basis, NW Natural will file for a prudence determination and a request to amortize costs to the extent that
remediation expenses exceed the insurance amortization. After insurance proceeds are fully amortized, if in a particular year the
request to collect deferred amounts exceeds one percent of Washington normalized revenues, then the excess will be collected
over three years with interest.
Legal Proceedings
NW Holdings is not currently party to any direct claims or litigation, though in the future it may be subject to claims and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business.
NW Natural is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the final outcome of any of
these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, including the matter described below, NW Natural and NW Holdings
do not expect that the ultimate disposition of any of these matters will have a material effect on financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flows.
OREGON STEEL MILLS SITE. In 2004, NW Natural was served with a third-party complaint by the Port of Portland (the Port) in
a Multnomah County Circuit Court case, Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. The Port of Portland. The Port alleges that in the 1940s and
1950s petroleum wastes generated by NW Natural's predecessor, Portland Gas & Coke Company, and 10 other third-party
defendants, were disposed of in a waste oil disposal facility operated by the United States or Shaver Transportation Company on
property then owned by the Port and now owned by Evraz Oregon Steel Mills. The complaint seeks contribution for unspecified
past remedial action costs incurred by the Port regarding the former waste oil disposal facility as well as a declaratory judgment
allocating liability for future remedial action costs. No date has been set for trial. In August 2017, the case was stayed pending
the outcome of the Portland Harbor allocation process or other mediation. Although the final outcome of this proceeding cannot
be predicted with certainty, NW Natural and NW Holdings do not expect the ultimate disposition of this matter will have a material
effect on NW Natural's or NW Holdings' financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

19. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
NW Holdings
On June 20, 2018, NWN Gas Storage, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Natural, entered into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement (the Agreement) that provides for the sale by NWN Gas Storage of all of the membership interests in Gill Ranch. Gill
Ranch owns a 75% interest in the natural gas storage facility located near Fresno, California known as the Gill Ranch Gas
Storage Facility. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) owns the remaining 25% interest in the Gill Ranch Gas Storage
Facility. The CPUC regulates Gill Ranch under a market-based rate model which allows for the price of storage services to be set
by the marketplace. The CPUC also regulates the issuance of securities, system of accounts, and regulates intrastate storage
services. The sale of Gill Ranch was approved by the CPUC in December 2019.
The Agreement provides for an initial cash purchase price of $25.0 million (subject to a working capital adjustment), plus
potential additional payments to NWN Gas Storage of up to $26.5 million in the aggregate if Gill Ranch achieves certain
economic performance levels for the first three full gas storage years (April 1 of one year through March 31 of the following year)
occurring after the closing and the remaining portion of the gas storage year during which the closing occurs.
As a result of the strategic shift away from the California gas storage market and the significance of Gill Ranch's financial results
in 2017, we concluded that the pending sale of Gill Ranch qualified it as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued
operations. As such, the assets and liabilities associated with Gill Ranch have been classified as discontinued operations assets
and discontinued operations liabilities, respectively, and, the results of Gill Ranch are presented, net of tax, as discontinued
operations separately from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. The expenses included in the results of
discontinued operations are the direct operating expenses incurred by Gill Ranch that may be reasonably segregated from the
costs of NW Holdings' continuing operations.

20. Subsequent Events
Suncadia Acquisition Completed
On January 31, 2020, NWN Water of Washington, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of NW Holdings, completed the acquisition
of Suncadia Water, a privately-owned water utility, and Suncadia Environmental, a wastewater company (collectively referred to
as Suncadia). The acquisition was made for preliminary cash consideration of $18.9 million, subject to closing adjustments.
Suncadia is based in Cle Elum, Washington and serves approximately 2,800 connections. A $1.0 million letter of credit
outstanding at NW Holdings as of December 31, 2019 for purposes of facilitating the acquisition was extinguished upon the close
of the transaction.
The preliminary allocation of consideration to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair value is not yet
complete as valuation procedures are pending. We expect the purchase price to be primarily allocated to property, plant and
equipment and goodwill. Acquisition costs were insignificant and were expensed as incurred.
See Note 2 and Note 15 for more information regarding business combinations.

 1. Report below the original cost of gas plant in service according to the prescribed accounts.
 2. In addition to Account 101, Gas Plant in Service (Classified), this page and the next include Account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold,
Account 103, Experimental Gas Plant Unclassified, and Account 106, Completed Construction Not Classified-Gas.
 3. Include in column (c) and (d), as appropriate corrections of additions and retirements for the current or preceding year.
 4. Enclose in parenthesis credit adjustments of plant accounts to indicate the negative effect of such accounts.
 5. Classify Account 106 according to prescribed accounts, on an estimated basis if necessary, and include the entries in column (c).Also to be
included in column (c) are entries for reversals of tentative distributions of prior year reported in column (b). Likewise, if the respondent has a
significant amount of plant retirements which have not been classified to primary accounts at the end of the year, include in column (d) a
tentative distribution of such retirements, on an estimated basis, with appropriate contra entry to the account for accumulated depreciation
provision. Include also in column (d) reversals of tentative distributions of prior year's unclassified retirements. Attach supplemental statement
showing the account distributions of these tentative classifications in columns (c) and (d), including the reversals of the prior years tentative
account distributions of these amounts. Careful observance of the above instructions and the texts of Account 101 and 106 will avoid serious
omissions of respondent's reported amount for plant actually in service at end of year.
 6. Show in column (f) reclassifications or transfers within utility plant accounts. Include also in column (f) the additions or reductions of primary
account classifications arising from distribution of amounts initially recorded in Account 102. In showing the clearance of Account 102, include
in column (e) the amounts with respect to accumulated provision for depreciation, acquisition adjustments, etc., and show in column (f) only the
offset to the debits or credits to primary account classifications.
 7. For Account 399, state the nature and use of plant included in this account and if substantial in amount submit a supplementary statement
showing subaccount classification of such plant conforming to the requirements of these pages.
 8. For each amount comprising the reported balance and changes in Account 102, state the property purchased or sold, name of vendor or
purchaser, and date of transaction. If proposed journal entries have been filed with the Commission as required by the Uniform System of
Accounts, give date of such filing.

                        Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Gas Utility Plant (Account 108)
 1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
 2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 10, column (c), and that reported for gas plant in
service, page 204-209, column (d), excluding retirements of nondepreciable property.
 3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when such plant
is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded and/or classified
to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book cost of the plant retired. In
addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional classifications.
 4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.
 5. At lines 7 and 14, add rows as necessary to report all data. Additional rows should be numbered in sequence, e.g., 7.01, 7.02, etc.

Footnotes:
1. Independent engineering studies are the basis for separation between noncurrent and current inventory.
2. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for method used to report inventories of gas in storage (page 122-A).
3. Engineering studies performed in 2019 resulted in reclass of working gas to long-term recoverable gas (FERC accounts 117) and non-utility
property (FERC account 121). In addition, $2.7 million of costs were reclassified from CWIP to long-term recoverable accounts when the Mist
pool specifically serving one storage customer went into service. The amounts shown in Line 4 primarily relate to these transactions.

                              OTHER REGULATORY LIABILITIES (Account 254) (Continued)
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and permanently lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from the existing
maximum rate of 35%, effective for our tax year beginning January 1, 2018. As a result, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
the date of enactment. The total amount of this revaluation to be accrued for the benefit of customers is $214.6 million, which includes a gross
up for income taxes of $56.8 million.
The following table shows the results of the remeasurement of excess deferred income taxes in 2017 and the FERC accounts affected:

                                        STATE OF OREGON - SITUS GAS PLANT IN SERVICE
1. Report below the original cost of gas plant in service according to the prescribed accounts.
2. In addition to Account 101, Gas Plant in Service (Classified), this page and the next include Account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold;
Account 103, Experimental Gas Plant Unclassified; and Account 106, Completed Construction Not Classified-Gas.
3. Include in column (c) or (d), as appropriate, corrections of additions and retirements for the current or preceding year.
4. Enclose in parentheses credit adjustments of plant accounts to indicate the negative effect of such accounts.
5. Classify Account 106 according to prescribed accounts, on an estimated basis if necessary, and include the entries in column (c). Also to be
included in column (c) are entries for reversals of tentative distributions or prior year reported in column (b). Likewise, if the respondent has a
significant amount of plant retirements which have not been classified to primary accounts at the end of the year, include in column (d) a
tentative distribution of such retirements, on Estimated basis, with appropriate contra entry to the account for accumulated depreciation
provision. Include also in column (d) reversals of tentative distributions of prior year unclassified retirements. Attach supplemental statement
showing the account distributions of theses tentative classifications in column (c) and (d), including the reversals of the prior years tentative
account distributions of these amounts. Careful observance of the above instructions and the texts of Accounts 101 and 106 will avoid serious
omissions of the reported amount of respondent’s plant actually in service at the end of year.
6. Show in column (f) reclassifications or transfers within utility plant accounts. Include also in column (f) the additions or reductions of primary
account classifications arising from distribution of amounts initially recorded in Account 102. In showing the clearance of Account 102, include
in column (e) the amounts with respect to accumulated provision for depreciation, acquisition adjustments, etc., and show in column (f) only the
offset to the debits or credits distributed in column (f) to primary account classifications.
7. For Account 399, state the nature and use of plant included in this account and if substantial in amount, submit a supplementary statement
showing subaccount classification of such plant conforming to the requirements of these pages.
8. For each amount comprising the reported balance and changes in Account 102, state the property purchased or sold, name of vendor or
purchaser, and date of transaction. If proposed journal entries have been filed with the Commission as required by the Uniform System of
Accounts, give also date of such filing.

   STATE OF OREGON - SITUS ACCUMULATED PROVISION FOR DEPRECIATION OF GAS UTILITY PLANT
                                                                  (Account 108)
1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 11, column (c), and that reported for gas plant in
service pages 24-27, column (d), excluding retirements of non-depreciable property.
3. The provisions of Account 108 of the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when such plant
is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded and/or classified
to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book cost of the plant retired.
In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional classifications.
4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.

1. Report below the original cost of gas plant in service
2. In addition to Account 101, Gas Plant In Service (Classified), this page and the next include Account 102,Gas Plant Purchased or Sold,
Account 103, Completed Construction Not Classified - Gas.
3. Include in column (c) or (d), as appropriate, corrections of additions and retirements for the current or preceding year.
4. Enclose in parentheses credit adjustments of plant accounts to indicate the negative effect of such accounts.
5. Classify Account 106 according to prescribed accounts, on an estimated basis if necessary, and include the entries in column (c). Also to be
included in column (c) are entries for reversals of tentative distributions or prior year reported in column (b). Likewise, if the respondent has a
significant amount of plant retirements which have not been classified to primary accounts at the end of the year, include in column (d)a
tentative distribution of such retirements, on Estimated basis, with appropriate contra entry to the account for accumulated depreciation
provision. Include also in column (d) reversals of tentative distributions of prior year unclassified retirements. Attach supplemental statement
showing the account distributions of these tentative classifications in column (c) and (d), including the reversals of the prior years tentative
account distributions of these amounts. Careful observance of the above instructions and the texts of Accounts 101 and106 will avoid serious
omissions of the reported amount of respondent's plant actually in service at the end of the year. (Continued on page 33)

2.Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 11, column (c), and that reported for gas plant in
service, pages 32-35, column (d)excluding retirements of non-depreciable property.
3.The provisions of Account 108 of the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when such plant
is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded and/or classified
to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book cost of the plant retired.
In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year-end in the appropriate functional classifications.
4.Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund of similar method of depreciation accounting.

                 STATE OF OREGON - GAS PURCHASES (Accounts 800, 801, 802, 803, 804.1 and 805)
1. Report particulars of gas purchases during the year in the manner prescribed below. (Code numbers to be used in reporting for Columns
(d), (e) and (f) will be supplied by the Commission.)
2. Provide subheadings and totals for prescribed accounts as follows
800         Natural Gas Well Head Purchases
801         Natural Gas Field Line Purchases
802         Natural Gas Gasoline Plant Outlet Purchases
803         Natural gas Transmission Line Purchases
804         Natural Gas City Gate Purchases
804.1       Liquefied natural Gas Purchases
805         Other gas Purchases
Purchases are to be reported in account number sequence, e.g. all purchases charged to Account 800, followed by charges to Account 801,
etc. Under each account number,purchases should be reported by states in alphabetical order.Totals are to be shown for each account in
Columns (k) and (l)and should agree with the books of accounts, or any differences reconciled.
3. Purchases may be reported by gas purchase contract totals (at the option of the respondent) where one contract includes two or more
FERC producer rate schedules or small producer certificates, provided that the same price is being paid for all gas purchased under the
contract. If two or more prices are in effect under the same contract, separate details for each price shall be reported. The name, and FERC
rate schedule or small producer certificate docket number of each seller included in the contract total shall be listed on separate sheets, clearly
cross-referenced. Where two or more prices are in effect, the sellers at each price are to be listed separately.
4. Purchases of less than 100,000 MCF per year per contract from sellers not affiliated with the reporting company may (at the option of the
respondent) be grouped by account number, except when the purchases were permanently discontinued during the reporting year. When
grouped purchases are reported, the number of grouped purchases is to be reported in Column (a). Only Columns (a), (k), (l), and (m) are to
be completed for grouped purchases; however, the Commission may request additional details when necessary. Grouped non-jurisdictional
purchases should be shown on a separate line.
5. Column instructions are as follows:
Columns (a) and (d) - In reporting the names of sellers under FERC rate schedules, use the names as they appear on the filed rate schedules.
Abbreviations may be used where necessary. The code number to be used is the Commission assigned number.
Column (b) - Give the name of the producing field only for purchases at the wellhead or from field lines. The plant name should be given for
purchases from gasoline plant outlets. If purchases under a contract are from more than one field or plant, use the name of the one
contributing the largest volume.Use a footnote to list the other fields or plants involved.
Column (c) - State the net rate in cents per MCF as of December 31 for the reported year, applicable to the volume shown in Column (k). The
net rate includes all applicable deductions and downward adjustments. The rate is effective if filed pursuant to applicable statues and
regulations and (as to FERC rates schedules) permitted by the commission to become effective.
Columns (e) and (f) - General Services Administration location code designations are to be used to designate the state and county where the
gas is received.Where gas is received in more than one county, use the code designation for the county having the largest volume,and by
footnote list the other countries involved.
Column (g) - List the assigned commission rate schedule number or small producer certificate docket number. Use the designation "NF" in
Column (g) to indicate non-jurisdictional purchases.
Column (h) - In some cases, two or more lines will be required to report a purchase, as when two or more rates are being paid under the same
contract, or when purchases under the same rate schedule are charged to more than one account. If for such reasons the producer rate
schedule or non-jurisdictional purchase contract appears on more than one line, enter a numerical code (selected by the respondent) in
Column (h) to so indicate. Once established,the same numerical suffix is to be used for all subsequent-year reporting of the purchase. If the
purchase was permanently discontinued during the reporting year, so indicate by an asterisk (*) in column (h). Column (h) is to be used also, to
enter any Commission assigned letter rate schedule suffix (e.g. R.S. No. 22A).
Column (i) - Show date of the gas purchase contract. If gas is purchased under a renegotiated contract show the dates of the original and
renegotiated contracts on the following line in brackets. If new acreage is dedicated by ratification of an existing contract, show the date of the
ratification, rather than the date of the original contract. Ifgas is being sold from a different reservoir than the original dedicated acreage
pursuant to Section 2.56 (f) (2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, place the letter "A" after the contract date.
Column (j) - Show, for each purchase, the approximate BTU per cubic foot, determined in accordance with the definition in item No. 7 of the
General Instructions for FERC Form 2.
Column (k) - State the volume of purchased gas as finally measured for purpose of determining the amount payable for the gas. Include
current year receipts of make-up gas that was paid for in prior years.
Column (l) - State the dollar amount (omit cents)paid and previously paid for the volumes of gas shown in Column (k).
Column (m) - State the average cost per MCF to the nearest hundredth of a cent. (Column (l) divided by Column (k) multiplied by 100).

                                       Gas Plant in Service (Accounts 101, 102, 103, and 106)
 1. Report below the original cost of gas plant in service according to the prescribed accounts.
 2. In addition to Account 101, Gas Plant in Service (Classified), this page and the next include Account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold,
Account 103, Experimental Gas Plant Unclassified, and Account 106, Completed Construction Not Classified-Gas.
 3. Include in column (c) and (d), as appropriate corrections of additions and retirements for the current or preceding year.
 4. Enclose in parenthesis credit adjustments of plant accounts to indicate the negative effect of such accounts.
 5. Classify Account 106 according to prescribed accounts, on an estimated basis if necessary, and include the entries in column (c).Also to be
included in column (c) are entries for reversals of tentative distributions of prior year reported in column (b). Likewise, if the respondent has a
significant amount of plant retirements which have not been classified to primary accounts at the end of the year, include in column (d) a
tentative distribution of such retirements, on an estimated basis, with appropriate contra entry to the account for accumulated depreciation
provision. Include also in column (d) reversals of tentative distributions of prior year's unclassified retirements. Attach supplemental statement
showing the account distributions of these tentative classifications in columns (c) and (d), including the reversals of the prior years tentative
account distributions of these amounts. Careful observance of the above instructions and the texts of Account 101 and 106 will avoid serious
omissions of respondent's reported amount for plant actually in service at end of year.
 6. Show in column (f) reclassifications or transfers within utility plant accounts. Include also in column (f) the additions or reductions of primary
account classifications arising from distribution of amounts initially recorded in Account 102. In showing the clearance of Account 102, include
in column (e) the amounts with respect to accumulated provision for depreciation, acquisition adjustments, etc., and show in column (f) only the
offset to the debits or credits to primary account classifications.
 7. For Account 399, state the nature and use of plant included in this account and if substantial in amount submit a supplementary statement
showing subaccount classification of such plant conforming to the requirements of these pages.
 8. For each amount comprising the reported balance and changes in Account 102, state the property purchased or sold, name of vendor or
purchaser, and date of transaction. If proposed journal entries have been filed with the Commission as required by the Uniform System of
Accounts, give date of such filing.

Northwest Natural Gas Company                    (2)    A Resubmission                                                           December 31, 2019
                        Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Gas Utility Plant (Account 108)
 1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
 2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 10, column (c), and that reported for gas plant in
service, page 204-209, column (d), excluding retirements of nondepreciable property.
 3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when such
plant is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded and/or
classified to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book cost of the
plant retired. In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional classifications.
 4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.
 5. At lines 7 and 14, add rows as necessary to report all data. Additional rows should be numbered in sequence, e.g., 7.01, 7.02, etc.
