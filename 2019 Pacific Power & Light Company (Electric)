PacifiCorp's Mortgage and Deed of Trust creates a lien on most of PacifiCorp's electric utility property, allowing the issuance of
bonds based on a percentage of utility property additions, bond credits arising from retirement of previously outstanding bonds or
deposits of cash. The amount of bonds that PacifiCorp may issue generally is also subject to a net earnings test. As of December 31,
2019, PacifiCorp estimated it would be able to issue up to $10.8 billion of new first mortgage bonds under the most restrictive
issuance test in the mortgage. Any issuances are subject to market conditions and amounts may be further limited by regulatory
authorizations or commitments or by covenants and tests contained in other financing agreements. PacifiCorp also has the ability to
release property from the lien of the mortgage on the basis of property additions, bond credits or deposits of cash.
In 2019, PacifiCorp completed a re-offering of variable rate pollution control bond obligations totaling $168 million, involving the
cancellation, at PacifiCorp's request, of $170 million of letters of credit support by the issuing banks. As a result, PacifiCorp's credit
facility support for outstanding variable rate pollution control bond obligations increased by $168 million.

                                               NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1)        Organization and Operations
PacifiCorp is a United States regulated electric utility company serving retail customers, including residential, commercial, industrial,
irrigation and other customers in portions of the states of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. PacifiCorp
owns, or has interests in, a number of thermal, hydroelectric, wind-powered and geothermal generating facilities, as well as electric
transmission and distribution assets. PacifiCorp also buys and sells electricity on the wholesale market with other utilities, energy
marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. PacifiCorp is subject to comprehensive state and federal
regulation. PacifiCorp is an indirect subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company ("BHE"), a holding company based in Des
Moines, Iowa that owns subsidiaries principally engaged in energy businesses. BHE is a consolidated subsidiary of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire Hathaway").
(2)        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
These financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC")
as set forth in its applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases, which is a comprehensive basis of
accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). These notes include
certain applicable disclosures required by GAAP adjusted to the FERC basis of presentation and include specific information
requested by the FERC.
The following are the significant differences between the FERC accounting and reporting standards and GAAP.
           Investments in Subsidiaries
           In accordance with FERC Order No. AC11-132-000, PacifiCorp accounts for its investment in subsidiaries using the equity
           method for FERC reporting purposes rather than consolidating the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of subsidiaries as
           required by GAAP. GAAP requires that entities in which a company holds a controlling financial interest be consolidated.
           Also in accordance with FERC Order No. AC11-132-000, PacifiCorp does not eliminate intercompany profit on transactions
           with equity investees as would be required under GAAP. The accounting treatment described above has no effect on net
           income or the combined retained earnings of PacifiCorp and undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.
           Costs of Removal
           Estimated removal costs that are recovered through approved depreciation rates, but that do not meet the requirements of a
           legal asset retirement obligation ("ARO") are reflected in the cost of removal regulatory liability under GAAP and as
           accumulated provision for depreciation under the FERC accounting and reporting standards.
           Income Taxes
           Accumulated deferred income taxes are classified as net non-current assets or liabilities on the balance sheet for GAAP.
           Under the FERC accounting and reporting standards, accumulated deferred income taxes are classified as gross non-current
           assets and gross non-current liabilities. Additionally, there are certain presentational differences between FERC and GAAP
           for amounts related to unrecognized tax benefits associated with temporary differences in accordance with FERC guidance.
           For GAAP, unrecognized tax benefits associated with temporary differences are reflected as other liabilities while for FERC
           the income tax impact of uncertain tax positions associated with temporary differences are reflected in accumulated deferred
           income taxes.
           Interest and penalties on income taxes for GAAP are classified as income tax expense. All such amounts are classified as
           interest income, interest expense and penalties under the FERC accounting and reporting standards.

                                               NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
           Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
           Pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions ("PBOP") are comprised of several different components of net
           periodic benefit costs. As required by GAAP, the service cost component is reported with other compensation costs arising
           from services rendered by employees, while the other components of net periodic benefit costs are presented outside of
           operating income. Additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is eligible for capitalization
           under GAAP. In accordance with FERC guidance, PacifiCorp continues to report the components of net periodic benefit
           costs for pension and PBOP on the statement of income and follows GAAP guidance to capitalize only the service cost
           component of net periodic benefit costs.
           Reclassifications
           Certain other reclassifications of balance sheet, income statement and cash flow amounts have been made in order to
           conform to the FERC basis of presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with FERC and GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the effects of regulation; certain assumptions
made in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits; AROs; income taxes; unbilled revenue; valuation of certain
financial assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts; and accounting for contingencies. Actual results may differ from the
estimates used in preparing the financial statements.
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation
PacifiCorp prepares its financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the
economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, PacifiCorp defers the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through
the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are
established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in
rates occur.
PacifiCorp continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and
liabilities are probable of inclusion in future rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates
from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit
PacifiCorp's ability to recover its costs. PacifiCorp believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and
its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and
regulatory climate at both the federal and state levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be
included in future rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or
re-established as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI").
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal
market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market
prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in order to estimate fair value. Different valuation techniques may be
appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange and
not under duress. Nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining fair value. Considerable judgment may be required in
interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments
Cash equivalents consist of funds invested in money market mutual funds, United States Treasury Bills and other investments with a
maturity of three months or less when purchased. Cash and cash equivalents exclude amounts where availability is restricted by legal
requirements, loan agreements or other contractual provisions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents included in other special funds
and other special deposits, primarily consist of escrow accounts for disputed funds, vendor retention, custodial and nuclear
decommissioning funds.
Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents consist of the following amounts as of December 31 (in millions):
                                                                                                  2019                  2018

Investments
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with realized gains and losses, as determined on a specific identification basis,
recognized in earnings and unrealized gains and losses recognized in AOCI, net of tax. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
PacifiCorp had no unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Trading securities are carried at fair value with realized
and unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are stated at the outstanding principal amount, net of an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts. The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on PacifiCorp's assessment of the collectability of amounts owed to PacifiCorp by its
customers. This assessment requires judgment regarding the ability of customers to pay or the outcome of any pending disputes. As of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $8 million, which is included in accumulated provision for
uncollectible accounts on the Comparative Balance Sheet.
Derivatives
PacifiCorp employs a number of different derivative contracts, which may include forwards, options, swaps and other agreements, to
manage price risk for electricity, natural gas and other commodities and interest rate risk. Derivative contracts are recorded on the
Comparative Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value unless they are designated as normal
purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. Derivative balances reflect offsetting permitted under
master netting agreements with counterparties and cash collateral paid or received under such agreements.
Commodity derivatives used in normal business operations that are settled by physical delivery, among other criteria, are eligible for
and may be designated as normal purchases or normal sales. Normal purchases or normal sales contracts are not marked-to-market
and settled amounts are recognized as operating revenue or operating expenses on the Statement of Income.
For PacifiCorp's derivative contracts, the settled amount is generally included in rates. Accordingly, the net unrealized gains and
losses associated with interim price movements on contracts that are accounted for as derivatives and probable of inclusion in rates
are recorded as regulatory assets. For a derivative contract not probable of inclusion in rates, changes in the fair value are recognized
in earnings.

Inventories
Inventories consist mainly of materials and supplies and fuel stocks (coal, natural gas and fuel oil), which are stated at the lower of
average cost or net realizable value.
Net Utility Plant
           General
Additions to utility plant are recorded at cost. PacifiCorp capitalizes all construction-related material, direct labor and contract
services, as well as indirect construction costs, which include debt and equity allowance for funds used during construction
("AFUDC"). The cost of additions and betterments are capitalized, while costs incurred that do not improve or extend the useful lives
of the related assets are generally expensed.
Depreciation and amortization are generally computed on the straight-line method based on composite asset class lives prescribed by
PacifiCorp's various regulatory authorities or over the assets' estimated useful lives. Depreciation studies are completed periodically to
determine the appropriate composite asset class lives, net salvage and depreciation rates. These studies are reviewed and rates are
ultimately approved by the various regulatory authorities. Net salvage includes the estimated future residual values of the assets and
any estimated removal costs recovered through approved depreciation rates. Estimated removal costs are recorded as either
accumulated provision for depreciation or an ARO liability on the Comparative Balance Sheet, depending on whether the obligation
meets the requirements of an ARO. As actual removal costs are incurred, the accumulated provision for depreciation or ARO liability
is reduced.
Generally when PacifiCorp retires or sells a component of utility plant, it charges the original cost, net of any proceeds from the
disposition, to accumulated provision for depreciation. Any gain or loss on disposals of all other assets is recorded through earnings.
Debt and equity AFUDC, which represent the estimated costs of debt and equity funds necessary to finance the construction of utility
plant, is capitalized as a component of utility plant, with offsetting credits to the Statement of Income. AFUDC is computed based on
guidelines set forth by the FERC. After construction is completed, PacifiCorp is permitted to earn a return on these costs as a
component of the related assets, as well as recover these costs through depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related assets.
           Asset Retirement Obligations
PacifiCorp recognizes AROs when it has a legal obligation to perform decommissioning, reclamation or removal activities upon
retirement of an asset. PacifiCorp's AROs are primarily associated with its generating facilities. The fair value of an ARO liability is
recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and is added to the carrying
amount of the associated asset, which is then depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. Subsequent to the initial
recognition, the ARO liability is adjusted for any revisions to the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows (with corresponding
adjustments to utility plant, net) and for accretion of the ARO liability due to the passage of time. The difference between the ARO
liability, the corresponding ARO asset included in utility plant and amounts recovered in rates to satisfy such liabilities is recorded as
a regulatory asset or liability.
           Impairment
PacifiCorp evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including utility plant, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering
event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the
residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated
recoverable amounts, appropriate FERC accounts are adjusted to write down the asset to the estimated fair value and any resulting
impairment loss is reflected on the Statement of Income. The impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value
of regulated assets.

Leases
PacifiCorp has non-cancelable operating leases primarily for land, office space, office equipment, and generating facilities and
finance leases consisting primarily of office buildings, natural gas pipeline facilities, and generating facilities. These leases generally
require PacifiCorp to pay for insurance, taxes and maintenance applicable to the leased property. Given the capital intensive nature of
the utility industry, it is common for a portion of lease costs to be capitalized when used during construction or maintenance of assets,
in which the associated costs will be capitalized with the corresponding asset and depreciated over the remaining life of that asset.
Certain leases contain renewal options for varying periods and escalation clauses for adjusting rent to reflect changes in price indices.
PacifiCorp does not include options in its lease calculations unless there is a triggering event indicating PacifiCorp is reasonably
certain to exercise the option. PacifiCorp's accounting policy is to not recognize lease obligations and corresponding right-of-use
assets for leases with contract terms of one year or less and not separate lease components from non-lease components and instead
account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with a lease as a single lease component.
Right-of-use assets will be evaluated for impairment in accordance with GAAP when a triggering event has occurred that might affect
the value and use of the assets being leased.
PacifiCorp's leases of generating facilities generally are in the form of long-term purchases of electricity, also known as power
purchase agreements ("PPA"). PPAs are generally signed before or during the early stages of project construction and can yield a
lease that has not yet commenced. These agreements are primarily for renewable energy and the payments are considered variable
lease payments as they are based on the amount of output.
PacifiCorp follows FERC accounting and reporting requirements and records operating and finance right-of-use assets in Account
101.1, Property under capital leases, and the current and noncurrent operating and finance lease liabilities are recorded in Account
243, Obligations under capital leases – Current and Account 227, Obligations under capital leases – Noncurrent, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
PacifiCorp recognizes revenues from contracts with customers ("Customer Revenue") upon transfer of control of promised goods or
services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which PacifiCorp expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. PacifiCorp records sales, franchise and excise taxes collected directly from customers and remitted directly to the taxing
authorities on a net basis on the Statement of Income.
Substantially all of PacifiCorp's Customer Revenue is derived from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory
commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission and distribution and have performance
obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are
provided. Other revenue consists of contractual agreements, including derivative arrangements.
Revenue recognized is equal to what PacifiCorp has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of
PacifiCorp's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. Payments for amounts billed are generally due from the
customer within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual
arrangements that establish the transaction price as well as the allocation of price amongst the separate performance obligations.
When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue
collected may be subject to refund and classified in accordance with FERC accounting standards.
Income Taxes
Berkshire Hathaway includes PacifiCorp in its United States federal income tax return. Consistent with established regulatory
practice, PacifiCorp's provision for income taxes has been computed on a stand-alone basis.

                                               NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities using estimated income tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income ("OCI") are
charged or credited directly to OCI. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with certain
property-related basis differences and other various differences that PacifiCorp deems probable to be passed on to its customers in
most state jurisdictions are charged or credited directly to a regulatory asset or liability and will be included in regulated rates when
the temporary differences reverse or as otherwise approved by PacifiCorp's various regulatory commissions. Other changes in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. Changes in deferred income tax assets
and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted income tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense or a regulatory asset or
liability in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the
amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized.
Investment tax credits are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related properties or as prescribed by
various regulatory commissions.
In determining PacifiCorp's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which
includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by PacifiCorp's various regulatory commissions. PacifiCorp's income tax
returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state and local income tax authorities that may give rise to different
interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before
these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. PacifiCorp recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest
benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of PacifiCorp's federal,
state and local income tax examinations is uncertain, PacifiCorp believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax
positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not
expected to have a material impact on PacifiCorp's financial results.
Segment Information
PacifiCorp currently has one segment, which includes its regulated electric utility operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements
On November 21, 2019, the FERC issued Order 864, "Public Utility Transmission Rate Changes to Address Accumulated Deferred
Income Taxes" requiring public utility transmission providers with transmission rates under an Open Access Transmission Tariff to
account for changes caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 and effective January 1, 2018 ("2017 Tax
Reform"). The FERC is requiring public utilities with transmission formula rates to include a mechanism in those transmission
formula rates to deduct any excess accumulated deferred income taxes ("ADIT") from or add any deficient ADIT to their rate bases.
Public utilities with transmission formula rates are also required to incorporate a mechanism to decrease or increase their income tax
allowances by any amortized excess or deficient ADIT, respectively. Finally, the FERC is requiring public utilities with transmission
formula rates to incorporate a new permanent worksheet into their transmission formula rates that will annually track information
related to excess or deficient ADIT. The FERC is requiring each public utility with transmission formula rates to submit a filing to
demonstrate compliance with the final rule, including revisions to its transmission formula rates, as necessary, within the later of (1)
30 days of the effective date of this ruling or (2) the public utility's next annual informational filing following the issuance of this
order. PacifiCorp is implementing the adoption of this guidance in its transmission rates under the Open Access Transmission Tariff
in FERC Docket No. ER11-3643, to be filed by May 15, 2020.

                                                 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02,
which creates FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, "Leases" and supersedes Topic 840 "Leases." This
guidance increases transparency and comparability among entities by recording lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet
and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease
payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The
recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed
from previous guidance. Following the issuance of ASU No. 2016-02, the FASB issued several ASUs that clarified the
implementation guidance for ASU No. 2016-02 but did not change the core principle of the guidance. PacifiCorp has elected to utilize
various practical expedients available to adopt ASU No. 2016-02, including (1) the package of three not requiring a reassessment of
(i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and
(iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases; (2) using hindsight in determining the lease term; and (3) not requiring a reassessment
of whether existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under ASC Topic 840 are or contain a
lease under ASC Topic 842. PacifiCorp adopted this guidance for all applicable contracts in effect as of January 1, 2019 under a
modified retrospective method and the adoption did not have a cumulative effect impact at the date of initial adoption. For FERC
reporting, PacifiCorp follows the accounting guidance for leases in accordance with FERC Order No. AI19-1-000, "Accounting and
Financial Reporting for Leases".
Subsequent Events
PacifiCorp has evaluated the impact of events occurring after December 31, 2019 up to February 21, 2020, the date that PacifiCorp's
GAAP financial statements were filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and has updated such evaluation
for disclosure purposes through April 10, 2020. These financial statements include all necessary adjustments and disclosures resulting
from these evaluations.
(3)        Net Utility Plant
The average depreciation and amortization rate applied to depreciable utility plant was 3.3% and 3.5% for the years ended
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including the impacts of accelerated depreciation for Oregon's share of certain wind
equipment retired as a result of wind repowering projects placed into service in 2019 and accelerated depreciation for Utah's share of
certain thermal plant units in 2018.
PacifiCorp filed a depreciation study in 2018 with all of its state public utility commissions, except the California Public Utilities
Commission. PacifiCorp is currently working with the commissions and interested parties and anticipates revised depreciation rates to
be effective January 1, 2021.
(4)        Jointly Owned Utility Facilities
Under joint facility ownership agreements with other utilities, PacifiCorp, as a tenant in common, has undivided interests in jointly
owned generation, transmission and distribution facilities. PacifiCorp accounts for its proportionate share of each facility, and each
joint owner has provided financing for its share of each facility. Operating costs of each facility are assigned to joint owners based on
their percentage of ownership or energy production, depending on the nature of the cost. Operating costs and expenses on the
Statement of Income include PacifiCorp's share of the expenses of these facilities.

As of December 31, 2019, PacifiCorp was in compliance with the covenants of its credit facilities and letter of credit arrangements.
PacifiCorp has a $600 million unsecured credit facility expiring in June 2022 and a $600 million unsecured credit facility expiring in
June 2022 with one remaining one-year extension option subject to lender consent. These credit facilities, which support PacifiCorp's
commercial paper program, certain series of its tax-exempt bond obligations and provide for the issuance of letters of credit, have
variable interest rates based on the Eurodollar rate or a base rate, at PacifiCorp's option, plus a spread that varies based on
PacifiCorp's credit ratings for its senior unsecured long-term debt securities.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings outstanding was 2.05% and
2.85%, respectively. These credit facilities require that PacifiCorp's ratio of consolidated debt, including current maturities, to total
capitalization not exceed 0.65 to 1.0 as of the last day of each quarter.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, PacifiCorp had $13 million and $184 million, respectively, of fully available letters of credit
issued under committed arrangements. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $13 million and $14 million, respectively, support certain
transactions required by third parties and generally have provisions that automatically extend the annual expiration dates for an
additional year unless the issuing bank elects not to renew a letter of credit prior to the expiration date.
(8)       Long-term Debt
PacifiCorp's long-term debt generally includes provisions that allow PacifiCorp to redeem the first mortgage bonds in whole or in
part at any time through the payment of a make-whole premium. Variable-rate tax-exempt bond obligations are generally redeemable
at par value.
In April 2020, PacifiCorp issued $400 million of its 2.70% First Mortgage Bonds due September 2030 and $600 million of its 3.30%
First Mortgage Bonds due March 2051. PacifiCorp intends to use the net proceeds to fund capital expenditures, primarily for
renewable resources and associated transmission projects and for general corporate purposes.

In March 2019, PacifiCorp issued $400 million of its 3.50% First Mortgage Bonds due June 2029 and $600 million of its 4.15% First
Mortgage Bonds due February 2050. PacifiCorp used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the short-term debt that was partially
incurred in January 2019 to repay all of PacifiCorp's $350 million, 5.50% First Mortgage Bonds due January 2019. PacifiCorp used
the remaining net proceeds to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2019, PacifiCorp had authorization from the Oregon Public Utility Commission ("OPUC") and the Idaho Public
Utilities Commission ("IPUC") to issue an additional $1.0 billion of long-term debt. PacifiCorp must make a notice filing with the
Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission ("WUTC") prior to any future issuance. Also, as of December 31, 2019,
PacifiCorp had an effective shelf registration statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up
to $1.0 billion additional first mortgage bonds through October 2021.
The issuance of PacifiCorp's first mortgage bonds is limited by available property, earnings tests and other provisions of PacifiCorp's
mortgage. Approximately $29 billion of PacifiCorp's eligible property (based on original cost) was subject to the lien of the mortgage
as of December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2019, the annual principal maturities of long-term debt for 2020 and thereafter, are as follows (in millions):

Income tax credits relate primarily to production tax credits earned by PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating facilities. Federal
renewable electricity production tax credits are earned as energy from qualifying wind-powered generating facilities is produced and
sold and are based on a per-kilowatt hour rate pursuant to the applicable federal income tax law. Wind-powered generating facilities
are eligible for the credits for 10 years from the date the qualifying generating facilities are placed in-service. Amortization of excess
deferred income taxes is primarily attributable to the amortization of $91 million of Oregon allocated excess deferred income taxes
pursuant to the Oregon Renewable Adjustment Clause ("RAC") settlement, whereby a portion of Oregon allocated excess deferred
income taxes was used to accelerate depreciation on Oregon's share of certain repowered wind facilities. Amortization of excess
deferred income taxes in 2018 is primarily attributable to the amortization of $127 million of Utah allocated excess deferred income
taxes pursuant to a 2017 Tax Reform settlement approved by the Utah Public Service Commission, whereby a portion of Utah

The United States Internal Revenue Service has closed its examination of PacifiCorp's income tax returns through December 31,
2011. The statute of limitations for PacifiCorp's state income tax returns have expired through December 31, 2011, with the exception
of California, Utah and Oregon, for which the statutes have expired through December 31, 2009. In addition, Idaho's statute of
limitations has expired through December 31, 2015, except for the impact of any federal audit adjustments. The statute of limitations
expiring for state filings may not preclude the state from adjusting the state net operating loss carryforward utilized in a year for
which the statute of limitations is not closed.
2017 Tax Reform
2017 Tax Reform enacted significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including, among other things, a reduction in the United
States federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In 2018, PacifiCorp agreed to refund or defer the impact of the tax law
change with each of its state regulatory commissions. Although PacifiCorp anticipated amortizing protected excess deferred income
taxes using the Average Rate Assumption Method as originally disclosed in its 2018 FERC Form No. 1, PacifiCorp will be using the
Reverse South Georgia Method to amortize protected excess deferred income taxes over the remaining regulatory life of each asset or
group of assets in all jurisdictions. The period of time over which non-protected excess deferred income taxes are amortized will be
determined in future proceedings, as previously disclosed, or as noted in the applicable state sections below.
          Oregon
In December 2018, PacifiCorp proposed to reduce customer rates to reflect the lower annual current income tax expense in Oregon
resulting from 2017 Tax Reform. PacifiCorp reached an all-party settlement on the amortization of the current income tax expense
benefits and the deferral of the decision regarding the ratemaking treatment of excess deferred income tax balances until no later than
PacifiCorp's next general rate proceeding. The settlement, which resulted in a rate reduction of $48 million, or 3.7%, effective
February 1, 2019, was approved by the OPUC in January 2019.
In December 2018, PacifiCorp filed a 2019 RAC application requesting recovery of $37 million, or a 2.8% increase in rates,
associated with repowering of approximately 900 megawatts of company-owned and installed wind facilities expected to be
completed in 2019. In March 2019, the application was updated to request recovery of $32 million, or a 2.5% increase in rates. In
August 2019, PacifiCorp filed an all-party settlement for the 2019 RAC that was approved by the OPUC in September 2019,
providing for a total rate increase of $24 million, or 1.8%, subject to final cost updates. The settlement agreement provides for rates to
be increased as the repowering projects are completed. Based on the in-service dates and final cost updates, the first rate increase of
$9 million or 0.7% was effective October 1, 2019, for four repowered facilities, the second rate increase of $1 million, or 0.1%, was
effective December 1, 2019, for one repowered facility and the third rate increase of $5 million or 0.4%, was effective January 1,
2020, for two repowered facilities. A final rate increase of $4.8 million, or 0.4 percent, was effective April 1, 2020 for the final two
remaining repowered facilities that were placed in service by the end of February 2020.

As part of the commission-approved RAC settlement, parties agreed that the Oregon-allocated net book value of certain undepreciated
equipment replaced as a result of those repowerings captured in the 2019 RAC will be depreciated and offset with excess deferred
income taxes resulting from 2017 Tax Reform. In 2019, accelerated depreciation of $120 million and offsetting amortization of excess
deferred income taxes was recognized based on repowering activities completed through December 31, 2019.
In February 2020, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case in Oregon requesting an increase in base rates of $78 million, or 6.0%, effective
January 1, 2021, a separate tariff rider to recover costs associated with the early retirement of Cholla Unit 4 for an increase of $17
million annually from January 2021 through April 2025 and an annual credit to customers of $25 million for amortization of
remaining deferred income tax benefits associated with 2017 Tax Reform over a three-year period beginning January 2021. The
request for the increase in base rates reflects recovery of Energy Vision 2020 investments, updated depreciation rates and rate design
modernization proposals.
          Wyoming
In March 2020, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case in Wyoming requesting an increase in base rates of $7 million, or 1.1 percent,
effective January 1, 2021. The increase reflects recovery of Energy Vision 2020 investments, updated depreciation rates and rate
design modernization proposals. The request includes a revision to the Energy Cost Adjustment Mechanism ("ECAM") to eliminate
the sharing band, approval to discontinue operations and cost recovery for the early retirement of Cholla Unit No. 4 generating
facility. The proposed increase reflects several rate mitigation measures that include use of the remaining 2017 Tax Reform benefits to
buy down plant balances and creation of regulatory assets for certain coal-fired generation units.
In April 2018, PacifiCorp filed a partial settlement related to the impact of 2017 Tax Reform with the Wyoming Public Service
Commission ("WPSC") that provided a rate reduction of $23 million, or 3.3%, effective July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, with the
remaining tax savings to be deferred with offsets to other costs. In June 2018, PacifiCorp filed reports with the WPSC with the
calculation of the full impact of the tax law change on revenue requirement of $28 million annually, comprised of $20 million in
current tax savings and $8 million for the amortization of excess deferred income tax balances. In March 2019, the WPSC issued a
written order approving the continued annual rate reduction of $23 million until base rates are reset in the next general rate proceeding
and a $4 million offset to PacifiCorp's 2018 ECAM rates. The order reflected $20 million of current tax savings and was updated to
reflect a projection of $7 million for amortization of excess deferred income tax balances. In April 2019, PacifiCorp filed a new
application updating the amount of benefits being returned to customers. PacifiCorp continued the interim rate reduction that includes
the previously approved $23 million and an additional $4 million reduction to offset the 2019 ECAM, effective June 15, 2019. A
settlement agreement was filed in November 2019 in which the parties agreed to an additional rate reduction of $9 million effective
December 1, 2019 through the end of calendar year 2020. The WPSC approved the settlement agreement at its hearing held in
November 2019.
          Washington
In December 2019, PacifiCorp submitted its 2021 general rate case with the WUTC requesting an overall decrease to rates of
approximately $4 million, or 1.1%, effective January 1, 2021. The case includes an increase in revenue requirement of $3 million,
offset by a proposed ten-year annual surcredit of $7 million, including interest, to customers primarily associated with the
amortization of excess deferred income taxes from 2017 Tax Reform. The case includes a request for approval of a new cost
allocation methodology, updated depreciation rates, recovery of Energy Vision 2020 investments, and rate design modernization
proposals.
          Idaho
In May 2018, the IPUC approved a rate reduction of $6 million, or 2.2%, effective June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2019, to pass back a
portion of the current tax benefits associated with 2017 Tax Reform. In March 2019, an all-party settlement resolving the treatment of
the remaining tax savings was filed with the IPUC. In May 2019, the IPUC approved the all-party settlement, which includes the
amortization of non-protected excess deferred income taxes over 7 years, resulting in the rate reduction for current tax savings being
adjusted to $8 million per year, effective June 1, 2019, and $3 million related to amortization of excess deferred income taxes from
2017 Tax Reform being applied as an offset to the 2019 ECAM.

           California
In April 2018, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case with the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC") for an overall rate
increase of $1 million, or 0.9%, effective January 1, 2019. A CPUC decision was issued in February 2020, resulting in an
approximate $6 million, or 6%, rate decrease effective February 6, 2020. As part of the CPUC decision, non-protected excess deferred
income taxes are being returned to California customers over three years.
(10)       Employee Benefit Plans
PacifiCorp sponsors defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of its employees, as well as
a defined contribution 401(k) employee savings plan ("401(k) Plan"). In addition, PacifiCorp contributes to a joint trustee pension
plan and a subsidiary previously contributed to a multiemployer pension plan for benefits offered to certain bargaining units.
Defined Benefit Plans
PacifiCorp's pension plans include non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, collectively the PacifiCorp Retirement Plan
("Retirement Plan"), and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). The Retirement Plan is closed to all non-union
employees hired after January 1, 2008. All non-union Retirement Plan participants hired prior to January 1, 2008 that did not elect to
receive equivalent fixed contributions to the 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 2009 earned benefits based on a cash balance formula
through December 31, 2016. Effective January 1, 2017, non-union employee participants with a cash balance benefit in the
Retirement Plan are no longer eligible to receive pay credits in their cash balance formula. In general for union employees, benefits
under the Retirement Plan were frozen at various dates from December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2011 as they are now being
provided with enhanced 401(k) Plan benefits. However, certain limited union Retirement Plan participants continue to earn benefits
under the Retirement Plan based on the employee's years of service and a final average pay formula. The SERP was closed to new
participants as of March 21, 2006 and froze future accruals for active participants as of December 31, 2014.
During 2018, the Retirement Plan incurred a settlement charge of $22 million as a result of excess lump sum distributions over the
defined threshold for the year ended December 31, 2018.
PacifiCorp's other postretirement benefit plan provides healthcare and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees.
Net Periodic Benefit Cost
For purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets, a market-related value is used. The market-related value of plan assets
is calculated by spreading the difference between expected and actual investment returns over a five-year period beginning after the
first year in which they occur.
Net periodic benefit credit or cost for the plans included the following components for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

The SERP has no plan assets; however, PacifiCorp has a Rabbi trust that holds corporate-owned life insurance and other investments
to provide funding for the future cash requirements of the SERP. The cash surrender value of all of the policies included in the Rabbi
trust, net of amounts borrowed against the cash surrender value, plus the fair market value of other Rabbi trust investments, was
$57 million and $52 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These assets are not included in the plan assets in the
above table, but are reflected in temporary cash investments, totaling $- million and $1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
respectively, and other investments, totaling $57 million and $51 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on the
Comparative Balance Sheet.
The projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plan were both in excess of the fair value of
the plan assets as of December 31, 2019.

          for 2020-2021 and 2.70% for 2022+ for union participants.
(2)       2018 Cash Balance Interest Crediting Rate assumption was 3.40% for 2019 and all future years for nonunion participants and 3.15% for 2019-2020 and
          3.25% for 2021+ for union participants.
In establishing its assumption as to the expected return on plan assets, PacifiCorp utilizes the asset allocation and return assumptions
for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets.
As a result of a plan amendment effective on January 1, 2017, the benefit obligation for the Retirement Plan is no longer affected by
future increases in compensation. As a result of a labor settlement reached with United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA") in
December 2014, the benefit obligation for the other postretirement plan is no longer affected by healthcare cost trends.

Contributions and Benefit Payments
Employer contributions to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are expected to be $4 million and $- million,
respectively, during 2020. Funding to PacifiCorp's Retirement Plan trust is based upon the actuarially determined costs of the plan and
the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the Pension
Protection Act of 2006, as amended. PacifiCorp considers contributing additional amounts from time to time in order to achieve
certain funding levels specified under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended. PacifiCorp evaluates a variety of factors,
including funded status, income tax laws and regulatory requirements, in determining contributions to its other postretirement benefit
plan.
The expected benefit payments to participants in PacifiCorp's pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2020 through 2024
and for the five years thereafter are summarized below (in millions):
                                                                                                            Projected Benefit Payments

Plan Assets
          Investment Policy and Asset Allocations
PacifiCorp's investment policy for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to balance risk and return through a diversified
portfolio of debt securities, equity securities and other alternative investments. Maturities for debt securities are managed to targets
consistent with prudent risk tolerances. The plans retain outside investment advisors to manage plan investments within the
parameters outlined by the PacifiCorp Pension Committee. The investment portfolio is managed in line with the investment policy
with sufficient liquidity to meet near-term benefit payments.
The target allocations (percentage of plan assets) for PacifiCorp's pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are as follows
as of December 31, 2019:
                                                                                                                                            Other

(1)       PacifiCorp's Retirement Plan trust includes a separate account that is used to fund benefits for the other postretirement benefit plan. In addition to this
          separate account, the assets for the other postretirement benefit plan are held in Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association ("VEBA") trusts, each of
          which has its own investment allocation strategies. Target allocations for the other postretirement benefit plan include the separate account of the Retirement
          Plan trust and the VEBA trusts.
(2)       For purposes of target allocation percentages and consistent with the plans' investment policy, investment funds are allocated based on the underlying
          investments in debt and equity securities.

For level 1 investments, a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an identical security in an active market is used
to record the fair value. For level 2 investments, the fair value is determined using pricing models based on observable market inputs.
Shares of mutual funds not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, private equity limited partnership interests, common and
commingled trust funds and investment entities are reported at fair value based on the net asset value per unit, which is used for
expedience purposes. A fund's net asset value is based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the fund less its liabilities.
Multiemployer and Joint Trustee Pension Plans
PacifiCorp contributes to the PacifiCorp/IBEW Local 57 Retirement Trust Fund ("Local 57 Trust Fund") (plan number 001) and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Energy West Mining Company, previously contributed to the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan (plan
number 002). Contributions to these pension plans are based on the terms of collective bargaining agreements.
As a result of the Utah Mine Disposition and UMWA labor settlement, PacifiCorp's wholly owned subsidiary, Energy West Mining
Company, triggered involuntary withdrawal from the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan in June 2015 when the UMWA employees ceased
performing work for the subsidiary. PacifiCorp recorded its estimate of the withdrawal obligation in December 2014 when withdrawal
was considered probable and deferred the portion of the obligation considered probable of recovery to a regulatory asset. PacifiCorp
has subsequently revised its estimate due to changes in facts and circumstances for a withdrawal occurring by July 2015. As
communicated in a letter received in August 2016, the plan trustees determined a withdrawal liability of $115 million. Energy West
Mining Company began making installment payments in November 2016 and has the option to elect a lump sum payment to settle the
withdrawal obligation. The ultimate amount paid by Energy West Mining Company to settle the obligation is dependent on a variety
of factors, including the results of ongoing negotiations with the plan trustees.
The Local 57 Trust Fund is a joint trustee plan such that the board of trustees is represented by an equal number of trustees from
PacifiCorp and the union. The Local 57 Trust Fund was established pursuant to the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act and although
formed with the ability for other employers to participate in the plan, there are no other employers that participate in this plan.
The risk of participating in multiemployer pension plans generally differs from single-employer plans in that assets are pooled such
that contributions by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and plan assets
cannot revert back to employers. If an employer ceases participation in the plan, the employer may be obligated to pay a withdrawal
liability based on the participants' unfunded, vested benefits in the plan. This occurred as a result of Energy West Mining Company's
withdrawal from the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan. If participating employers withdraw from a multiemployer plan, the unfunded
obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
The following table presents PacifiCorp's participation in individually significant joint trustee and multiemployer pension plans for
the years ended December 31 (dollars in millions):

The current collective bargaining agreements governing the Local 57 Trust Fund expire in 2023.
Defined Contribution Plan
PacifiCorp's 401(k) Plan covers substantially all employees. PacifiCorp's matching contributions are based on each participant's level
of contribution and, as of January 1, 2019, all participants receive contributions based on eligible pre-tax annual compensation.
Contributions cannot exceed the maximum allowable for tax purposes. PacifiCorp's contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $40 million
and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(11)       Asset Retirement Obligations
PacifiCorp estimates its ARO liabilities based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash
spending for a third party to perform the required work. Spending estimates are escalated for inflation and then discounted at a
credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. Changes in estimates could occur for a number of reasons, including changes in laws and regulations,
plan revisions, inflation and changes in the amount and timing of the expected work.
PacifiCorp does not recognize liabilities for AROs for which the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. Due to the indeterminate
removal date, the fair value of the associated liabilities on certain transmission, distribution and other assets cannot currently be
estimated, and no amounts are recognized on the financial statements other than those included in the accumulated provision for
depreciation established via approved depreciation rates in accordance with accepted regulatory practices. These accruals totaled
$1,019 million and $994 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of PacifiCorp's ARO liabilities for the years ended December 31

Certain of PacifiCorp's decommissioning and reclamation obligations relate to jointly owned facilities and mine sites. PacifiCorp is
committed to pay a proportionate share of the decommissioning or reclamation costs. In the event of a default by any of the other
joint participants, PacifiCorp may be obligated to absorb, directly or by paying additional sums to the entity, a proportionate share of
the defaulting party's liability. PacifiCorp's estimated share of the decommissioning and reclamation obligations are primarily
recorded as ARO liabilities.
(12)       Risk Management and Hedging Activities
PacifiCorp is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. PacifiCorp is principally exposed to
electricity, natural gas, coal and fuel oil commodity price risk as it has an obligation to serve retail customer load in its service
territories. PacifiCorp's load and generating facilities represent substantial underlying commodity positions. Exposures to commodity
prices consist mainly of variations in the price of fuel required to generate electricity and wholesale electricity that is purchased and
sold. Commodity prices are subject to wide price swings as supply and demand are impacted by, among many other unpredictable
items, weather, market liquidity, generating facility availability, customer usage, storage, and transmission and transportation
constraints. Interest rate risk exists on variable-rate debt and future debt issuances. PacifiCorp does not engage in a material amount of
proprietary trading activities.

PacifiCorp has established a risk management process that is designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, monitor and report, each
of the various types of risk involved in its business. To mitigate a portion of its commodity price risk, PacifiCorp uses commodity
derivative contracts, which may include forwards, options, swaps and other agreements, to effectively secure future supply or sell
future production generally at fixed prices. PacifiCorp manages its interest rate risk by limiting its exposure to variable interest rates
primarily through the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt and by monitoring market changes in interest rates. Additionally,
PacifiCorp may from time to time enter into interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps or locks, to mitigate
PacifiCorp's exposure to interest rate risk. No interest rate derivatives were in place during the periods presented. PacifiCorp does not
hedge all of its commodity price and interest rate risks, thereby exposing the unhedged portion to changes in market prices.
There have been no significant changes in PacifiCorp's accounting policies related to derivatives. Refer to Notes 2 and 13 for
additional information on derivative contracts.
The following table, which reflects master netting arrangements and excludes contracts that have been designated as normal under the
normal purchases or normal sales exception, summarizes the fair value of PacifiCorp's derivative contracts, on a gross basis, and
reconciles those amounts to the amounts presented on a net basis on the Comparative Balance Sheet (in millions):

          Credit Risk
PacifiCorp is exposed to counterparty credit risk associated with wholesale energy supply and marketing activities with other utilities,
energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants. Credit risk may be concentrated to the extent
PacifiCorp's counterparties have similar economic, industry or other characteristics and due to direct or indirect relationships among
the counterparties. Before entering into a transaction, PacifiCorp analyzes the financial condition of each significant wholesale
counterparty, establishes limits on the amount of unsecured credit to be extended to each counterparty and evaluates the
appropriateness of unsecured credit limits on an ongoing basis. To further mitigate wholesale counterparty credit risk, PacifiCorp
enters into netting and collateral arrangements that may include margining and cross-product netting agreements and obtains
third-party guarantees, letters of credit and cash deposits. If required, PacifiCorp exercises rights under these arrangements, including
calling on the counterparty's credit support arrangement.
          Collateral and Contingent Features
In accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts contain credit support provisions
that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the three
recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if
credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels ("credit-risk-related contingent features") or
provide the right for counterparties to demand "adequate assurance" if there is a material adverse change in PacifiCorp's
creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2019, PacifiCorp's credit ratings for its
senior secured debt and its issuer credit ratings for senior unsecured debt by Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's Rating
Services were investment grade.
The aggregate fair value of PacifiCorp's derivative contracts in liability positions with specific credit-risk-related contingent features
totaled $80 million and $113 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which PacifiCorp had posted collateral of
$47 million and $61 million, respectively, in the form of cash deposits. If all credit-risk-related contingent features for derivative
contracts in liability positions had been triggered as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, PacifiCorp would have been required to post
$27 million and $35 million, respectively, of additional collateral. PacifiCorp's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably
due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation or other factors.

(13)      Fair Value Measurements
The carrying value of PacifiCorp's cash, certain cash equivalents, receivables, other special funds, other investments, payables,
accrued liabilities and short-term borrowings approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
PacifiCorp has various financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on the financial statements using inputs from the
three levels of the fair value hierarchy. A financial asset or liability classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are as follows:
              Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that PacifiCorp has the
               ability to access at the measurement date.
              Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
               similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
               or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other
               means (market corroborated inputs).
              Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflect PacifiCorp's judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in
               pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists. PacifiCorp develops these inputs based on the best
               information available, including its own data.
The following table presents PacifiCorp's assets and liabilities recognized on the Comparative Balance Sheet and measured at fair
value on a recurring basis (in millions):

Derivative contracts are recorded on the Comparative Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are stated at estimated fair value
unless they are designated as normal purchases or normal sales and qualify for the exception afforded by GAAP. When available, the
fair value of derivative contracts is estimated using unadjusted quoted prices for identical contracts in the market in which PacifiCorp
transacts. When quoted prices for identical contracts are not available, PacifiCorp uses forward price curves. Forward price curves
represent PacifiCorp's estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement at future dates.
PacifiCorp bases its forward price curves upon market price quotations, when available, or internally developed and commercial
models, with internal and external fundamental data inputs. Market price quotations are obtained from independent energy brokers,
exchanges, direct communication with market participants and actual transactions executed by PacifiCorp. Market price quotations for
certain major electricity and natural gas trading hubs are generally readily obtainable for the first three years; therefore, PacifiCorp's
forward price curves for those locations and periods reflect observable market quotes. Market price quotations for other electricity and
natural gas trading hubs are not as readily obtainable for the first three years. Given that limited market data exists for these contracts,
as well as for those contracts that are not actively traded, PacifiCorp uses forward price curves derived from internal models based on
perceived pricing relationships to major trading hubs that are based on unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of these
derivative contracts is a function of underlying forward commodity prices, interest rates, currency rates, related volatility,
counterparty creditworthiness and duration of contracts. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion regarding PacifiCorp's risk
management and hedging activities.
PacifiCorp's investments in money market mutual funds and investment funds are stated at fair value and are primarily accounted for
as available-for-sale securities. When available, PacifiCorp uses a readily observable quoted market price or net asset value of an
identical security in an active market to record the fair value. In the absence of a quoted market price or net asset value of an identical
security, the fair value is determined using pricing models or net asset values based on observable market inputs and quoted market
prices of securities with similar characteristics.
PacifiCorp's long-term debt is carried at cost on the financial statements. The fair value of PacifiCorp's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair
value measurement and has been estimated based upon quoted market prices, where available, or at the present value of future cash
flows discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risks. The carrying value of PacifiCorp's
variable-rate long-term debt approximates fair value because of the frequent repricing of these instruments at market rates. The
following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of PacifiCorp's long-term debt as of December 31 (in millions):
                                                                       2019                                   2018

Legal Matters
PacifiCorp is party to a variety of legal actions arising out of the normal course of business. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or
exemplary damages. PacifiCorp does not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material impact on its financial
results.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
PacifiCorp is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards,
emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected
species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact PacifiCorp's current and future operations. PacifiCorp
believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

           Hydroelectric Relicensing
PacifiCorp is a party to the 2016 amended Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement ("KHSA"), which is intended to resolve
disputes surrounding PacifiCorp's efforts to relicense the Klamath Hydroelectric Project. The KHSA does not guarantee dam removal.
Instead, it establishes a process for PacifiCorp, the states of Oregon and California ("States") and other stakeholders to assess whether
dam removal can occur consistent with the settlement's terms. For PacifiCorp, the key elements of the settlement include: (1) a
contribution from PacifiCorp's Oregon and California customers capped at $200 million plus $250 million in California bond funds;
(2) complete indemnification from harms associated with dam removal; (3) transfer of the FERC license to a third-party dam removal
entity, the Klamath River Renewal Corporation ("KRRC"), who would conduct dam removal; and (4) ability for PacifiCorp to operate
the facilities for the benefit of customers until dam removal commences.
In September 2016, the KRRC and PacifiCorp filed a joint application with the FERC to transfer the license for the four mainstem
Klamath dams from PacifiCorp to the KRRC. Over the past two years, the KRRC has been supplementing the application with
additional information about its financial, technical, and legal capacity to become the licensee. In July 2019, the KRRC provided the
FERC with additional information about its financial capacity to become a licensee, including updated cost estimates, and its
insurance, bonding and liability transfer package. The FERC is evaluating the KRRC's information and the proposed license transfer.
The KRRC will continue to refine its insurance, bonding and liability transfer package, and PacifiCorp will review the KRRC's
capacity to fulfill its indemnity obligation under the KHSA. If certain conditions in the amended KHSA are not satisfied (e.g.,
inadequate funding or inability of KRRC to satisfy its indemnification obligation) and the license does not transfer to the KRRC,
PacifiCorp will resume relicensing with the FERC.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision in the Hoopa Valley Tribe v. FERC
litigation, in January 2019, finding that the states of California and Oregon have waived their Clean Water Act, Section 401, water
quality certification authority over the Klamath hydroelectric project relicensing. This decision has the potential to limit the ability of
the States to impose water quality conditions on new and relicensed projects. Environmental interests, supported by California,
Oregon and other states, asked the court to rehear the case, which was denied. Subsequently, environmental groups, supported by
numerous states, filed a petition for certiorari before the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on December 9, 2019,
thereby allowing the circuit court opinion to stand as a final and unappealable decision.
As of December 31, 2019, PacifiCorp's assets included $29 million of costs associated with the Klamath hydroelectric system's
mainstem dams and the associated relicensing and settlement costs, which are being depreciated and amortized in accordance with
state regulatory approvals in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho through December 31, 2022.
           Hydroelectric Commitments
Certain of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric licenses contain requirements for PacifiCorp to make certain capital and operating expenditures
related to its hydroelectric facilities. PacifiCorp estimates it is obligated to make capital expenditures of approximately $168 million
over the next 10 years related to these licenses.

          Purchased Electricity Contracts - Commercially Operable
As part of its energy resource portfolio, PacifiCorp acquires a portion of its electricity through long-term purchases and exchange
agreements. PacifiCorp has several power purchase agreements with solar or wind-powered generating facilities that are not included
in the table above as the payments are based on the amount of energy generated and there are no minimum payments. Refer to Note 5
for information on lease commitments.
Included in the minimum fixed annual payments for purchased electricity above are commitments to purchase electricity from several
hydroelectric systems under long-term arrangements with public utility districts. These purchases are made on a "cost-of-service"
basis for a stated percentage of system output and for a like percentage of system operating expenses and debt service. These costs are
included in operating expenses on the Statement of Income. PacifiCorp is required to pay its portion of operating costs and its portion
of the debt service, whether or not any electricity is produced. These arrangements accounted for less than 5% of PacifiCorp's 2019
and 2018 energy sources.
          Purchased Electricity Contracts - Non-commercially Operable
PacifiCorp has several contracts for purchases of electricity from facilities that have not yet achieved commercial operation. To the
extent any of these facilities do not achieve commercial operation, PacifiCorp has no obligation to the counterparty.
          Fuel Contracts
PacifiCorp has "take or pay" coal and natural gas contracts that require minimum payments.
          Construction Commitments
PacifiCorp's construction commitments included in the table above relate to firm commitments and include costs associated with
certain generating plant, transmission and distribution projects.

          Transmission
PacifiCorp has contracts for the right to transmit electricity over other entities' transmission lines to facilitate delivery to PacifiCorp's
customers.
          Easements
PacifiCorp has non-cancelable easements for land on which certain of its assets, primarily wind-powered generating facilities, are
located.
Guarantees
PacifiCorp has entered into guarantees as part of the normal course of business and the sale of certain assets. These guarantees are not
expected to have a material impact on PacifiCorp's financial results.
(15)      Preferred Stock
In the event of voluntary liquidation, all preferred stock is entitled to stated value or a specified preference amount per share plus
accrued dividends. Upon involuntary liquidation, all preferred stock is entitled to stated value plus accrued dividends. Dividends on
all preferred stock are cumulative. Holders also have the right to elect members to the PacifiCorp Board of Directors in the event
dividends payable are in default in an amount equal to four full quarterly payments.
(16)      Common Shareholder's Equity
Through PPW Holdings, BHE is the sole shareholder of PacifiCorp's common stock. The state regulatory orders that authorized
BHE's acquisition of PacifiCorp contain restrictions on PacifiCorp's ability to pay dividends to the extent that they would reduce
PacifiCorp's common equity below specified percentages of defined capitalization. As of December 31, 2019, the most restrictive of
these commitments prohibits PacifiCorp from making any distribution to PPW Holdings or BHE without prior state regulatory
approval to the extent that it would reduce PacifiCorp's common equity below 44% of its total capitalization, excluding short-term
debt and current maturities of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2019, PacifiCorp's actual common equity percentage, as calculated
under this measure, was 53%, and PacifiCorp would have been permitted to dividend $2.4 billion under this commitment.
These commitments also restrict PacifiCorp from making any distributions to either PPW Holdings or BHE if PacifiCorp's senior
unsecured debt rating is BBB- or lower by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Fitch Ratings, or Baa3 or lower by
Moody's Investor Service, as indicated by two of the three rating services. As of December 31, 2019, PacifiCorp met the minimum
required senior unsecured debt ratings for making distributions.
PacifiCorp is also subject to a maximum debt-to-total capitalization percentage under various financing agreements as further
discussed in Note 7.
(17)      Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures
The summary of supplemental cash flow disclosures as of and for the years ended December 31 is as follows (in millions):

                                ACCUMULATED PROVISION FOR DEPRECIATION OF ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT (Account 108)
1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, Line 11, column (c), and that reported for
electric plant in service, pages 204-207, column 9d), excluding retirements of non-depreciable property.
3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when
such plant is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded
and/or classified to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book
cost of the plant retired. In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional
classifications.
4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.

                            RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NET INCOME WITH TAXABLE INCOME FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
1. Report the reconciliation of reported net income for the year with taxable income used in computing Federal income tax accruals and show
computation of such tax accruals. Include in the reconciliation, as far as practicable, the same detail as furnished on Schedule M-1 of the tax return for
the year. Submit a reconciliation even though there is no taxable income for the year. Indicate clearly the nature of each reconciling amount.
2. If the utility is a member of a group which files a consolidated Federal tax return, reconcile reported net income with taxable net income as if a separate
return were to be field, indicating, however, intercompany amounts to be eliminated in such a consolidated return. State names of group member, tax
assigned to each group member, and basis of allocation, assignment, or sharing of the consolidated tax among the group members.
3. A substitute page, designed to meet a particular need of a company, may be used as Long as the data is consistent and meets the requirements of the
above instructions. For electronic reporting purposes complete Line 27 and provide the substitute Page in the context of a footnote.

Enter the amounts in both columns (d) and (e). The balancing of this page is not affected by the inclusion of these taxes.
3. Include in column (d) taxes charged during the year, taxes charged to operations and other accounts through (a) accruals credited to taxes accrued,
(b)amounts credited to proportions of prepaid taxes chargeable to current year, and (c) taxes paid and charged direct to operations or accounts other than
accrued and prepaid tax accounts.
4. List the aggregate of each kind of tax in such manner that the total tax for each State and subdivision can readily be ascertained.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

1. Report all sales for resale (i.e., sales to purchasers other than ultimate consumers) transacted on a settlement basis other than power
exchanges during the year. Do not report exchanges of electricity ( i.e., transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for
energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges on this schedule. Power exchanges must be reported on the
Purchased Power schedule (Page 326-327).
2. Enter the name of the purchaser in column (a). Do note abbreviate or truncate the name or use acronyms. Explain in a footnote any
ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the purchaser.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projected load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirements service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier's service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for tong-term service. "Long-term" means five years or Longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for Long-term firm service which meets the definition
of RQ service. For all transactions identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the earliest date
that either buyer or setter can unilaterally get out of the contract.
 IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service except that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but Less
than five years.
SF - for short-term firm service. Use this category for all firm services where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for Long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or Longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service except that "intermediate-term" means
Longer than one year but Less than five years.

non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote.
AD - for Out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. Group requirements RQ sales together and report them starting at line number one. After listing all RQ sales, enter "Subtotal - RQ" in
column (a). The remaining sales may then be listed in any order. Enter "Subtotal-Non-RQ" in column (a) after this Listing. Enter "Total''

benefits. Pensions and benefits expense is associated with labor and generally charged to
operations and maintenance expense and construction work in progress, therefore, pursuant
to FERC Docket No. FA16-4-000, these pensions and benefits are offset in Account 929,
Duplicate charges-credit.
In accordance with PacifiCorp's formula rate settlement agreement in FERC Docket No.
ER11-3643-000, Section 3.4.2.9 states, in part, all regulatory asset amortizations should
be excluded from the calculation of the wholesale transmission revenue requirement and
charges under the wholesale formula rates, unless approved by the Commission. During the
year ended December 31, 2019, pension and postretirement regulatory asset amortization was
$(2,684,722).

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

                                                             (Including power exchanges)
1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours

                                                             (Including power exchanges)
1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

                                                             (Including power exchanges)
1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.

                                                             (Including power exchanges)
1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported

2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.
5. For requirements RQ purchases and any type of service involving demand charges imposed on a monnthly (or longer) basis, enter the
monthly average billing demand in column (d), the average monthly non-coincident peak (NCP) demand in column (e), and the average
monthly coincident peak (CP) demand in column (f). For all other types of service, enter NA in columns (d), (e) and (f). Monthly NCP
demand is the maximum metered hourly (60-minute integration) demand in a month. Monthly CP demand is the metered demand during
the hour (60-minute integration) in which the supplier's system reaches its monthly peak. Demand reported in columns (e) and (f) must
be in megawatts. Footnote any demand not stated on a megawatt basis and explain.
6. Report in column (g) the megawatthours shown on bills rendered to the respondent. Report in columns (h) and (i) the megawatthours
of power exchanges received and delivered, used as the basis for settlement. Do not report net exchange.
7. Report demand charges in column (j), energy charges in column (k), and the total of any other types of charges, including
out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The
total amount in column (i) must be reported as Exchange Delivered on Page 401, line 13.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

1. Report all power purchases made during the year. Also report exchanges of electricity (i.e., transactions involving a balancing of
debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.) and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
2. Enter the name of the seller or other party in an exchange transaction in column (a). Do not abbreviate or truncate the name or use
acronyms. Explain in a footnote any ownership interest or affiliation the respondent has with the seller.
3. In column (b), enter a Statistical Classification Code based on the original contractual terms and conditions of the service as follows:
RQ - for requirements service. Requirements service is service which the supplier plans to provide on an ongoing basis (i.e., the supplier
includes projects load for this service in its system resource planning). In addition, the reliability of requirement service must be the
same as, or second only to, the supplier’s service to its own ultimate consumers.
LF - for long-term firm service. "Long-term" means five years or longer and "firm" means that service cannot be interrupted for economic
reasons and is intended to remain reliable even under adverse conditions (e.g., the supplier must attempt to buy emergency energy from
third parties to maintain deliveries of LF service). This category should not be used for long-term firm service firm service which meets
the definition of RQ service. For all transaction identified as LF, provide in a footnote the termination date of the contract defined as the
earliest date that either buyer or seller can unilaterally get out of the contract.
IF - for intermediate-term firm service. The same as LF service expect that "intermediate-term" means longer than one year but less
than five years.
SF - for short-term service. Use this category for all firm services, where the duration of each period of commitment for service is one
year or less.
LU - for long-term service from a designated generating unit. "Long-term" means five years or longer. The availability and reliability of
service, aside from transmission constraints, must match the availability and reliability of the designated unit.
IU - for intermediate-term service from a designated generating unit. The same as LU service expect that "intermediate-term" means
longer than one year but less than five years.
EX - For exchanges of electricity. Use this category for transactions involving a balancing of debits and credits for energy, capacity, etc.
and any settlements for imbalanced exchanges.
OS - for other service. Use this category only for those services which cannot be placed in the above-defined categories, such as all
non-firm service regardless of the Length of the contract and service from designated units of Less than one year. Describe the nature of
the service in a footnote for each adjustment.

AD - for out-of-period adjustment. Use this code for any accounting adjustments or "true-ups" for service provided in prior reporting
years. Provide an explanation in a footnote for each adjustment.
4. In column (c), identify the FERC Rate Schedule Number or Tariff, or, for non-FERC jurisdictional sellers, include an appropriate
designation for the contract. On separate lines, list all FERC rate schedules, tariffs or contract designations under which service, as
identified in column (b), is provided.

out-of-period adjustments, in column (l). Explain in a footnote all components of the amount shown in column (l). Report in column (m)
the total charge shown on bills received as settlement by the respondent. For power exchanges, report in column (m) the settlement
amount for the net receipt of energy. If more energy was delivered than received, enter a negative amount. If the settlement amount (l)
include credits or charges other than incremental generation expenses, or (2) excludes certain credits or charges covered by the
agreement, provide an explanatory footnote.
8. The data in column (g) through (m) must be totalled on the last line of the schedule. The total amount in column (g) must be reported
as Purchases on Page 401, line 10. The total amount in column (h) must be reported as Exchange Received on Page 401, line 12. The

Year-to-date 2019 Net System Load information was compiled using reservations in OASIS at
time of Transmission System Peak. Long-term firm point-to-point reservations have been
adjusted so that the monthly megawatt reservations represent an amount at system input as
measured by the transmission system loss factor. This adjustment has been made to ensure
that transmission rates are designed fairly and in a non-discriminatory manner and is
consistent with the system input measurement utilized for other long-term firm users of
PacifiCorp’s transmission system, including network service.

 9. Items under Cost of Plant are based on U. S. of A. Accounts. Production expenses do not include Purchased Power, System Control and Load
 Dispatching, and Other Expenses Classified as Other Power Supply Expenses. 10. For IC and GT plants, report Operating Expenses, Account Nos.
 547 and 549 on Line 25 "Electric Expenses," and Maintenance Account Nos. 553 and 554 on Line 32, "Maintenance of Electric Plant." Indicate plants
 designed for peak load service. Designate automatically operated plants. 11. For a plant equipped with combinations of fossil fuel steam, nuclear
 steam, hydro, internal combustion or gas-turbine equipment, report each as a separate plant. However, if a gas-turbine unit functions in a combined cycle
 operation with a conventional steam unit, include the gas-turbine with the steam plant. 12. If a nuclear power generating plant, briefly explain by
 footnote (a) accounting method for cost of power generated including any excess costs attributed to research and development; (b) types of cost units

 9. Items under Cost of Plant are based on U. S. of A. Accounts. Production expenses do not include Purchased Power, System Control and Load
 Dispatching, and Other Expenses Classified as Other Power Supply Expenses. 10. For IC and GT plants, report Operating Expenses, Account Nos.
 547 and 549 on Line 25 "Electric Expenses," and Maintenance Account Nos. 553 and 554 on Line 32, "Maintenance of Electric Plant." Indicate plants
 designed for peak load service. Designate automatically operated plants. 11. For a plant equipped with combinations of fossil fuel steam, nuclear
 steam, hydro, internal combustion or gas-turbine equipment, report each as a separate plant. However, if a gas-turbine unit functions in a combined cycle
 operation with a conventional steam unit, include the gas-turbine with the steam plant. 12. If a nuclear power generating plant, briefly explain by
 footnote (a) accounting method for cost of power generated including any excess costs attributed to research and development; (b) types of cost units
 used for the various components of fuel cost; and (c) any other informative data concerning plant type fuel used, fuel enrichment type and quantity for the
 report period and other physical and operating characteristics of plant.

 9. Items under Cost of Plant are based on U. S. of A. Accounts. Production expenses do not include Purchased Power, System Control and Load
 Dispatching, and Other Expenses Classified as Other Power Supply Expenses. 10. For IC and GT plants, report Operating Expenses, Account Nos.
 547 and 549 on Line 25 "Electric Expenses," and Maintenance Account Nos. 553 and 554 on Line 32, "Maintenance of Electric Plant." Indicate plants
 designed for peak load service. Designate automatically operated plants. 11. For a plant equipped with combinations of fossil fuel steam, nuclear
 steam, hydro, internal combustion or gas-turbine equipment, report each as a separate plant. However, if a gas-turbine unit functions in a combined cycle
 operation with a conventional steam unit, include the gas-turbine with the steam plant. 12. If a nuclear power generating plant, briefly explain by
 footnote (a) accounting method for cost of power generated including any excess costs attributed to research and development; (b) types of cost units
 used for the various components of fuel cost; and (c) any other informative data concerning plant type fuel used, fuel enrichment type and quantity for the
 report period and other physical and operating characteristics of plant.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by

of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

 7. Do not report the same transmission line structure twice. Report Lower voltage Lines and higher voltage lines as one line. Designate in a footnote if
 you do not include Lower voltage lines with higher voltage lines. If two or more transmission line structures support lines of the same voltage, report the
 pole miles of the primary structure in column (f) and the pole miles of the other line(s) in column (g)
 8. Designate any transmission line or portion thereof for which the respondent is not the sole owner. If such property is leased from another company,
 give name of lessor, date and terms of Lease, and amount of rent for year. For any transmission line other than a leased line, or portion thereof, for which
 the respondent is not the sole owner but which the respondent operates or shares in the operation of, furnish a succinct statement explaining the
 arrangement and giving particulars (details) of such matters as percent ownership by respondent in the line, name of co-owner, basis of sharing expenses
 of the Line, and how the expenses borne by the respondent are accounted for, and accounts affected. Specify whether lessor, co-owner, or other party is
 an associated company.
 9. Designate any transmission line leased to another company and give name of Lessee, date and terms of lease, annual rent for year, and how
 determined. Specify whether lessee is an associated company.
 10. Base the plant cost figures called for in columns (j) to (l) on the book cost at end of year.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

1. Report information concerning transmission lines, cost of lines, and expenses for year. List each transmission line having nominal voltage of 132
kilovolts or greater. Report transmission lines below these voltages in group totals only for each voltage.
2. Transmission lines include all lines covered by the definition of transmission system plant as given in the Uniform System of Accounts. Do not report
substation costs and expenses on this page.
3. Report data by individual lines for all voltages if so required by a State commission.
4. Exclude from this page any transmission lines for which plant costs are included in Account 121, Nonutility Property.
5. Indicate whether the type of supporting structure reported in column (e) is: (1) single pole wood or steel; (2) H-frame wood, or steel poles; (3) tower; or
(4) underground construction If a transmission line has more than one type of supporting structure, indicate the mileage of each type of construction by
the use of brackets and extra lines. Minor portions of a transmission line of a different type of construction need not be distinguished from the remainder
of the line.
6. Report in columns (f) and (g) the total pole miles of each transmission line. Show in column (f) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is
reported for the line designated; conversely, show in column (g) the pole miles of line on structures the cost of which is reported for another line. Report
pole miles of line on leased or partly owned structures in column (g). In a footnote, explain the basis of such occupancy and state whether expenses with
respect to such structures are included in the expenses reported for the line designated.

 7. Do not report the same transmission line structure twice. Report Lower voltage Lines and higher voltage lines as one line. Designate in a footnote if
 you do not include Lower voltage lines with higher voltage lines. If two or more transmission line structures support lines of the same voltage, report the
 pole miles of the primary structure in column (f) and the pole miles of the other line(s) in column (g)
 8. Designate any transmission line or portion thereof for which the respondent is not the sole owner. If such property is leased from another company,
 give name of lessor, date and terms of Lease, and amount of rent for year. For any transmission line other than a leased line, or portion thereof, for which
 the respondent is not the sole owner but which the respondent operates or shares in the operation of, furnish a succinct statement explaining the
 arrangement and giving particulars (details) of such matters as percent ownership by respondent in the line, name of co-owner, basis of sharing expenses
 of the Line, and how the expenses borne by the respondent are accounted for, and accounts affected. Specify whether lessor, co-owner, or other party is
 an associated company.
 9. Designate any transmission line leased to another company and give name of Lessee, date and terms of lease, annual rent for year, and how
 determined. Specify whether lessee is an associated company.

This footnote applies to all occurrences of "Administrative services under the IASA" on
page 429. "IASA" is the Intercompany Administrative Services Agreement between Berkshire
Hathaway Energy Company ("BHE") and its subsidiaries. Amounts which are chargeable to or
from another affiliate are assigned first by coding to the specific affiliate. These
charges are based on actual labor, benefits and operational costs incurred. Amounts not
directly assignable to an individual affiliate, such as work performed where multiple
affiliates benefit, are assigned on the basis of allocations, as described below:
Labor and Assets: An equal weighting of each company's labor and assets expressed as a
percentage of the whole ((labor % + assets %) ÷ 2) determines the portion assigned to each
company. Labor is 12 months ended through December of the prior year. Assets are total
assets at December 31 of the prior year. Nine combinations of this allocator are used for
allocating services that benefit different companies within the BHE organization.
Information Technology Infrastructure: Allocates costs related to shared information
technology infrastructure owned by the affiliate to other benefited affiliates based on an
aggregation of various measures of usage of such infrastructure including storage capacity
utilized, number of servers utilized, server processing times, etc.
Plant: This allocator distributes costs of managing the corporate insurance function based
on assets for each affiliate.
