     ---------------------------
        DEFINITIONS
     ---------------------------
  1. See the Uniform System of Accounts for a definition of control.
  2. Direct control is that which is exercised without interposition of an intermediary.
  3. Indirect control is that which is exercised by the interposition of an intermediary that exercises direct control.
  4. Joint control is that in which neither interest can effectively control or direct action without the consent of the other, as where the
voting control is equally divided between two holders, or each party holds a veto power over the other. Joint control may exist by mutual
agreement or understanding between two or more parties who together have control within the meaning of the definition of control in
the Uniform System of Accounts, regardless of the relative voting rights of each party.

 classifications arising from distribution of amounts initially recorded in Account 102. In showing the clearance of Account 102, include in column (e) the
amounts with respect to accumulated provision for depreciation, acquisition adjustments, etc., and show in column (f) only the offset to the debits or
credits to primary account classifications.
  7. For Account 399, state the nature and use of plant included in this account and if substantial in amount submit a supplementary statement showing
subaccount classification of such plant conforming to the requirements of these pages.

and date of transaction. If proposed journal entries have been filed with the Commission as required by the Uniform System of Accounts, give date of
such filing.

  1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
  2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 10, column (c), and that reported for gas
plant in service, page 204-209, column (d), excluding retirements of nondepreciable property.
  3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when
such plant is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been
recorded and/or classified to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize
the book cost of the plant retired. In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate
functional classifications.
  4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.
  5. At lines 7 and 14, add rows as necessary to report all data. Additional rows should be numbered in sequence, e.g., 7.01, 7.02, etc.

                                  Reconciliation of Reported Net Income with Taxable Income for Feder Income Taxes
  1. Report the reconciliation of reported net income for the year with taxable income used in computing Federal Income Tax accruals
and show computation of such tax accruals. Include in the reconciliation, as far as practicable, the same detail as furnished on
Schedule M-1 of the tax return for the year. Submit a reconciliation even though there is no taxable income for the year. Indicate
clearly the nature of each reconciling amount.
  2. If the utility is a member of a group that files consolidated Federal tax return, reconcile reported net income with taxable net income
as if a separate return were to be filed, indicating, however, intercompany amounts to be eliminated in such a consolidated return. State
names of group members, tax assigned to each group member, and basis of allocation, assignments, or sharing of the consolidated tax
among the group members.

 Report below the distribution of total salaries and wages for the year. Segregate amounts originally charged to clearing accounts to Utility Departments, Construction, Plant Removals
and Other Accounts, and enter such amounts in the appropriate lines and columns provided. Salaries and wages billed to the Respondent by an affiliated company must be assigned to
the particular operating function(s) relating to the expenses.
 In determining this segregation of salaries and wages originally charged to clearing accounts, a method of approximation giving substantially correct results may be used. When
reporting detail of other accounts, enter as many rows as necessary numbered sequentially starting with 75.01, 75.02, etc.

   specific account(s) charged or credited.
   2. On lines 7, 14, 22 and 30 report only the dekatherms of gas provided by shippers under tariff terms and conditions for gathering , production/ extraction/processing, transmission, distribution and storage service
   and the use of that gas for compressor fuel, other operational purposes and lost and unaccounted for. The dekatherms must be broken out by functional categories on Lines 2-6, 9-13, 16-21 and 24-29.
   The dekatherms must be reported in column (d) unless the company has discounted or negotiated rates which should be reported in columns (b) and (c).
   3. On lines 7, 14, 22 and 30 report only the dollar amounts of gas provided by shippers under tariff terms and conditions for gathering, production/ extraction/processing, transmission, distribution and storage

   6. On lines 32-37 report the dekatherms and dollar value of the excess or deficiency in shipper supplied gas broken out by functional category and whether recourse rate, discounted or negotiated rate.
   7. On lines 39 through 51 report the dekatherms, the dollar amount and the account(s) credited in Column (o) for the dispositions of gas listed in column (a).
   8. On lines 53 through 65 report the dekatherms, the dollar amount and the account(s) debited in Column (n) for the sources of gas reported in column (a).
   9. On lines 66 and 67, report forwardhaul and backhaul volume in Dths of throughput.
   10. Where appropriate, provide a full explanation of the allocation process used in reported numbers in a footnote.
