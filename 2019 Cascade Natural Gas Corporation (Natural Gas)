I.    Prepare all reports in conformity with the Uniform System of Accounts (USofA) (18 C.F.R. Part 201). Interpret all
      accounting words and phrases in accordance with the USofA.
II.   Enter in whole numbers (dollars or Dth) only, except where otherwise noted. (Enter cents for averages and figures
      per unit where cents are important. The truncating of cents is allowed except on the four basic financial statements
      where rounding is required.) The amounts shown on all supporting pages must agree with the amounts entered on
      the statements that they support. When applying thresholds to determine significance for reporting purposes, use for
      balance sheet accounts the balances at the end of the current reporting period, and use for statement of income
      accounts the current year's year to date amounts.
III   Complete each question fully and accurately, even if it has been answered in a previous report. Enter the word
      "None" where it truly and completely states the fact.
IV.   For any page(s) that is not applicable to the respondent, omit the page(s) and enter "NA," "NONE," or "Not
      Applicable" in column (d) on the List of Schedules, pages 2 and 3.
V.    Enter the month, day, and year for all dates. Use customary abbreviations. The "Date of Report" included in the
      header of each page is to be completed only for resubmissions.
VI.   Generally, except for certain schedules, all numbers, whether they are expected to be debits or credits, must be
      reported as positive. Numbers having a sign that is different from the expected sign must be reported by enclosing
      the numbers in parentheses.
VII   For any resubmissions, submit the electronic filing using the form submission only. Please explain the reason for
      the resubmission in a footnote to the data field.
VIII. Footnote and further explain accounts or pages as necessary.
IX.   Do not make references to reports of previous periods/years or to other reports in lieu of required entries, except as
      specifically authorized.
X.    Wherever (schedule) pages refer to figures from a previous period/year, the figures reported must be based upon
      those shown by the report of the previous period/year, or an appropriate explanation given as to why the different
      figures were used.
XI.   Report all gas volumes in Dth unless the schedule specifically requires the reporting in another unit of
      measurement.

at any time during the year. If control ceased prior to end of year, give particulars (details) in a footnote.

        DEFINITIONS
     ---------------------------
  1. See the Uniform System of Accounts for a definition of control.
  2. Direct control is that which is exercised without interposition of an intermediary.
  3. Indirect control is that which is exercised by the interposition of an intermediary that exercises direct control.
  4. Joint control is that in which neither interest can effectively control or direct action without the consent of the other, as where the
voting control is equally divided between two holders, or each party holds a veto power over the other. Joint control may exist by mutual
agreement or understanding between two or more parties who together have control within the meaning of the definition of control in the
Uniform System of Accounts, regardless of the relative voting rights of each party.

NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware and is a direct wholly owned subsidiary
of MDU. The Company is parent to the following regulated businesses: Montana-Dakota, and its division
Great Plains, PCEH, and its wholly owned subsidiary Cascade, and PIEH, and its wholly owned subsidiary
Intermountain. On January 2, 2019, MDU announced the completion of the Holding Company
Reorganization, which resulted in Montana-Dakota and Great Plains becoming a subsidiary of the Company.
The Company’s natural gas distribution operations sell natural gas at retail and provide natural gas
transportation services. Montana-Dakota’s electric operation generates, transmits, and distributes electricity.
The Company provides service to approximately 143,000 electric and 978,000 residential, commercial and
industrial gas customers in 458 communities. The Montana-Dakota service territory consists of towns in
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Great Plains distributes natural gas in western
Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota. The Cascade service territory consists of towns in western,
southeastern and south-central Washington and central and eastern Oregon. The Intermountain service
territory is located solely in southern Idaho, encompassing communities located across the Snake River Plain.
Montana-Dakota is subject to regulation by the FERC, NDPSC, MTPSC, SDPUC, and WYPSC. Great Plains
is subject to regulation by the MNPUC and the NDPSC. Cascade is subject to regulation by the WUTC and
the OPUC. Intermountain is subject to regulation by the IPUC. These markets tend to be seasonal and sales to
residential and commercial customers are influenced by fluctuations in temperature, particularly during the
winter season for the natural gas operations and during the summer season for the electric operation.
Consumption is also influenced by the energy efficiency of customers’ appliances, as well as consumer
decisions to reduce natural gas and electric usage in response to higher prices.
The consolidated financial statements and disclosures of the Company are presented in accordance with
GAAP. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, except for certain
transactions that fall under regulatory accounting in accordance with GAAP. The statements also include the
ownership interests in the assets, liabilities and expenses of jointly owned electric transmission and
generating facilities. The accounting policies followed by the Company’s subsidiaries are generally subject to
the Uniform System of Accounts of the FERC.
The Company’s subsidiaries account for certain income and expense items under the provisions of regulatory
accounting, which requires these businesses to defer as regulatory assets or liabilities certain items that would
have otherwise been reflected as expense or income, respectively, based on the expected regulatory treatment
in future rates. The expected recovery or flowback of these deferred items generally is based on specific
ratemaking decisions or precedent for each item. Regulatory assets and liabilities are being amortized
consistently with the regulatory treatment established by the FERC and the applicable state public service
commissions. See Note 5 for more information regarding the nature and amounts of these regulatory
deferrals.
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA which includes lower corporate tax rates,
disallowance of immediate expensing for regulated utility property and modifying or repealing many other
business deductions and credits. The reduction in the corporate tax rate was effective on January 1, 2018. The
effects of the change in tax laws or rates must be accounted for in the period of enactment, which resulted in
the Company making reasonable estimates of the impact of the reduction in corporate tax rate on the
                                                       123-3

                                   Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Company's net deferred tax liabilities during the fourth quarter of 2017. The SEC issued, and the FASB
adopted, rules that allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the TCJA
to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. At December 31, 2018, the Company finalized the
estimates from the fourth quarter of 2017 and no material adjustments were recorded to income from
continuing operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company early adopted the requirements of the ASU on leases, as further
discussed in this note, as well as in Note 3. As such, results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019,
are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be
reported in accordance with the historic accounting for leases.
Management has also evaluated the impact of events occurring after December 31, 2019, up to the date of the
issuance of these consolidated financial statements on March 30, 2020, that would require recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts
Accounts receivable consists primarily of trade receivables from the sale of goods and services which are
recorded at the invoiced amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The total balance of receivables past
due 90 days or more was $1.6 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through a review of past due balances and other specific
account data. Account balances are written off when management determines the amounts to be uncollectible.
The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1.4 million and $1.5
million, respectively.
Accounts receivable also consists of accrued unbilled revenue representing revenues recognized in excess of
amounts billed. Accrued unbilled revenue at the Company was $100.8 million and $96.2 million at December
31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Inventories and natural gas in storage
Natural gas in storage is valued at lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out method at Montana-
Dakota and Great Plains; and, the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method at
Cascade and the average cost method at Intermountain. The majority of other inventories are valued at lower
of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method. The portion of the cost of natural gas in storage
expected to be used within 12 months was included in inventories. Inventories at December 31 consisted of:

  Total                            $   21,578 $     20,897
The remainder of natural gas in storage, which largely represents the cost of gas required to maintain pressure
levels for normal operating purposes was included in deferred charges and other assets – other and was $1.6
million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Investments
The Company's investments include the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, an insurance contract,
and other miscellaneous investments. The Company measures its investment in the insurance contract at fair
value with any unrealized gains and losses recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
Company has not elected the fair value option for its other investments. For more information, see Notes 6
and 11.
Property, plant and equipment
Additions to property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. When regulated assets are retired, or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business, the original cost of the asset is charged to
accumulated depreciation. With respect to the retirement or disposal of all other assets, the resulting gains or
losses are recognized as a component of income. The Company is permitted to capitalize AFUDC on
regulated construction projects and to include such amounts in rate base when the related facilities are placed
in service. The amount of AFUDC for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
                                          2019               2018
                                              (In thousands)
 AFUDC - borrowed                    $     2,535         $     1,943
 AFUDC - equity                      $       669         $     1,074
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the average useful lives of the
assets. The Company collects removal costs for plant assets in regulated utility rates. These amounts are
recorded as regulatory liabilities, which are included in deferred credits and other liabilities - other.

Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
the assets, compared to the carrying value of the assets. If impairment has occurred, the amount of the
impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the
carrying value is greater than the fair value. No impairment losses were recorded in 2019 and 2018.
Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances could require the recognition of impairment losses at some
future date.
Leases
Lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease
payments over the expected lease term. The Company recognizes leases with an original lease term of 12
months or less in income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and does not recognize a
corresponding right-of-use asset or lease liability. The Company determines the lease term based on the non-
cancelable and cancelable periods in each contract. The non-cancelable period consists of the term of the
contract that is legally enforceable and cannot be canceled by either party without incurring a significant
                                                      123-6

                                    Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
penalty. The cancelable period is determined by various factors that are based on who has the right to cancel a
contract. If only the lessor has the right to cancel the contract, the Company will assume the contract will
continue. If the lessee is the only party that has the right to cancel the contract, the Company looks to asset,
entity and market-based factors. If both the lessor and the lessee have the right to cancel the contract, the
Company assumes the contract will not continue.
The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the lease liabilities is based upon the implied rate
within each contract. If the rate is unknown or cannot be determined, the Company uses an incremental
borrowing rate, which is determined by the length of the contract, asset class and the Company's borrowing
rates, as of the commencement date of the contract.
Regulatory assets and liabilities
The Company accounts for certain income and expense items under the provisions of regulatory accounting,
which requires the Company to defer as regulatory assets or liabilities certain items that would have otherwise
been reflected as expense or income. The Company records regulatory assets or liabilities at the time the
Company determines the amounts to be recoverable in current or future rates.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and
intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment
annually, which the Company completes in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company has determined that the reporting units
for its goodwill impairment test are its operating segments, or components of an operating segment, that
constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management
regularly reviews the operating results.
Goodwill impairment, if any, is measured by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
value. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not
impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company must record an
impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the
fair value of the reporting unit. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no impairment
losses recorded. At December 31, 2019, the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of its
reporting units.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates which
include assumptions about the Company's future revenue, profitability and cash flows, amount and timing of
estimated capital expenditures, inflation rates, risk adjusted capital cost, operational plans, and current and
future economic conditions, among others. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a
weighted combination of income and market approaches. The Company uses a discounted cash flow
methodology for its income approach. Under the income approach, the discounted cash flow model
determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specified period and a residual
value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period. Both values are discounted using a rate which
reflects the best estimate of the risk adjusted capital cost at each reporting unit. Risk adjusted capital cost of
4.0 percent, and a long-term growth rate projection of 1.7 percent were utilized in the goodwill impairment
test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value

using various multiples derived from enterprise value to EBITDA for comparative peer companies for each
respective reporting unit. These multiples are applied to operating data for each reporting unit to arrive at an
indication of fair value. In addition, the Company adds a reasonable control premium when calculating the
fair value utilizing the peer multiples, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale in
an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company believes that the estimates and assumptions
used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or
service to a customer. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer,
and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company is
considered an agent for certain taxes collected from customers. As such, the Company presents revenues net
of these taxes at the time of sale to be remitted to governmental authorities, including sales and use taxes.
The Company generates revenue from the sales of electric and natural gas products and services, which
includes retail and transportation services. The Company establishes a customer's retail or transportation
service account based on the customer's application/contract for service, which indicates approval of a
contract for service. The contract identifies an obligation to provide service in exchange for delivering or
standing ready to deliver the identified commodity; and the customer is obligated to pay for the service as
provided in the applicable tariff. The product sales are based on a fixed rate that includes a base and per-unit
rate, which are included in approved tariffs as determined by state or federal regulatory agencies. The
quantity of the commodity consumed or transported determines the total per-unit revenue. The service
provided, along with the product consumed or transported, are a single performance obligation because both
are required in combination to successfully transfer the contracted product or service to the customer.
Revenues are recognized over time as customers receive and consume the products and services. The method
of measuring progress toward the completion of the single performance obligation is on a per-unit output
method basis, with revenue recognized based on the direct measurement of the value to the customer of the
goods or services transferred to date. For contracts governed by the Company’s utility tariffs, amounts are
billed monthly with the amount due between 15 and 22 days of receipt of the invoice depending on the
applicable state’s tariff. For other contracts not governed by tariff, payment terms are net 30 days. At this
time, the Company has no material obligations for returns, refunds or other similar obligations.
The Company recognizes all other revenues when services are rendered or goods are delivered.
Asset retirement obligations
The Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the Company capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period and
the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, the
Company either settles the obligation for the recorded amount or incurs a regulatory asset or liability.
Legal costs
The Company expenses external legal fees as they are incurred.
Natural gas costs recoverable or refundable through rate adjustments

                        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                     Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Under the terms of certain orders of the applicable state public service commissions, the Company is
deferring natural gas commodity, transportation and storage costs that are greater or less than amounts
presently being recovered through its existing rate schedules. Such orders generally provide that these
amounts are recoverable or refundable through rate adjustments within a period ranging from 12 to 36 months
from the time such costs are paid. Natural gas costs refundable through rate adjustments were $23.8 million
and $30.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Natural gas costs recoverable through rate
adjustments were $89.2 million and $42.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Income taxes
MDU and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns and combined and separate state
income tax returns. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement that exists between MDU and its subsidiaries,
federal income taxes paid by MDU, as parent of the consolidated group, are allocated to the individual
subsidiaries based on the ratio of the separate company computations of tax. MDU makes a similar allocation
for state income taxes paid in connection with combined state filings. The Company provides deferred federal
and state income taxes on all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the Company's assets
and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date. Excess deferred income tax balances associated with the Company's rate-
regulated activities have been recorded as a regulatory liability and are included in deferred credits and other
liabilities. These regulatory liabilities are expected to be reflected as a reduction in future rates charged to
customers in accordance with applicable regulatory procedures.
Consistent with orders and directives of the IPUC, Intermountain does not provide state deferred income tax
expense for certain income tax temporary differences and instead recognizes the tax impact currently
(commonly referred to as flow-through accounting) for ratemaking and financial reporting. Therefore, the
Company’s effective income tax rate is impacted as these differences arise and reverse.
The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for investment tax credits and amortizes the credits on
regulated electric and natural gas distribution plant over various periods that conform to the ratemaking
treatment prescribed by the applicable state public service commissions.
The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting guidance on accounting for
income taxes on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) the Company determines whether it is more-
likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and
(2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes
the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate
settlement with the related tax authority. Tax positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria are
reflected as a tax liability. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized
tax benefits in income taxes.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Estimates are used for items such as long-lived assets and goodwill; property

regulatory assets expected to be recovered in rates charged to customers; unbilled revenues; actuarially
determined benefit costs; asset retirement obligations; lease classification; present value of right-of-use assets

available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating
results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.
New accounting standards
Recently adopted accounting standards
ASU 2016-02 - Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued this ASU guidance relating to ASC 842 - Leases.
The guidance required lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for
operating and financing leases. The guidance remained largely the same for lessors, although some changes
were made to better align lessor accounting with the new lessee accounting and to align with the revenue
recognition standard. The guidance also required additional disclosures, both quantitative and qualitative,
related to operating and financing leases for the lessee and sales-type, direct financing and operating leases
for the lessor. The Company early adopted the standard on January 1, 2019.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 - Leases: Targeted Improvements, an accounting standard
update to ASU 2016-02. This ASU provided an entity the option to adopt the guidance using one of two
modified retrospective approaches. An entity could adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective
transition approach beginning in the earliest year presented in the financial statements. This method of
adoption would have required the restatement of prior periods reported and the presentation of lease
disclosures under the new guidance for all periods reported. The additional transition method of adoption,
introduced by ASU 2018-11, allowed entities the option to apply the guidance on the date of adoption by
recognizing a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings during the period of adoption and did not
require prior comparative periods to be restated.
The Company early adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, utilizing the additional transition method of
adoption applied on the date of adoption and the practical expedient that allowed the Company to not reassess
whether an expired or existing contract contained a lease, the classification of leases or initial direct costs.
The Company did not identify any cumulative effect adjustments. The Company also adopted a short-term
leasing policy as the lessee where leases with a term of 12 months or less are not included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As a practical expedient, a lessee may choose not to separate nonlease components from lease components
and instead account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component. The election shall be
made by asset class. The Company has elected to adopt the lease/nonlease component practical expedient for
all asset classes as the lessee. The Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight when
assessing the lease term or impairment of right-of-use assets for the existing leases on the date of adoption.
In January 2018, the FASB issued a practical expedient for land easements under the new lease guidance. The
practical expedient permits an entity to elect the option to not evaluate land easements under the new
guidance if they existed or expired before the adoption of the new lease guidance and were not previously
accounted for as leases under the previous lease guidance. Once an entity adopts the new guidance, the entity
should apply the new guidance on a prospective basis to all new or modified land easements. The Company
has adopted this practical expedient.

The Company formed a lease implementation team to review and assess existing contracts to identify and
evaluate those containing leases. Additionally, the team implemented new and revised existing software to
meet the reporting and disclosure requirements of the standard. The Company also assessed the impact the
standard had on its processes and internal controls and identified new and updated existing internal controls
and processes to ensure compliance with the new lease standard; such modifications were not deemed to be
significant. During the assessment phase, the Company used various surveys, reconciliations and analytic
methodologies to ensure the completeness of the lease inventory. The Company determined that most of the
current operating leases were subject to the guidance and were recognized as operating lease liabilities and
right-of-use assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption. On January 1, 2019, the Company
recorded $20.7 million to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as a result of the initial adoption of the
guidance. In addition, the Company evaluated the impact the new guidance had on lease contracts where the
Company is the lessor and determined it did not have a significant impact to the Company's financial
statements.
ASU 2017-04 - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance
on simplifying the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2, which required an entity to measure
the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the
carrying amount of such goodwill. This guidance requires entities to perform a quantitative impairment test,
previously Step 1, to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. Entities will continue to have the option of
performing a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The
guidance also requires additional disclosures if an entity has one or more reporting units with zero or negative
carrying amounts of net assets. The Company early adopted the guidance on a prospective basis beginning
with the preparation of its 2019 goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2019. The adoption of the
guidance did not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, cash flows or
disclosures.
ASU 2018-15 - Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing
Arrangement that is a Service Contract In August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for
implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The guidance aligns the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract
similar to the costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software and such capitalized costs to be
expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement. Costs incurred during the preliminary and
postimplementation stages should continue to be expensed as activities are performed. The capitalized costs
are required to be presented on the balance sheet in the same line the prepayment for the fees associated with
the hosting arrangement would be presented. In addition, the expense related to the capitalized
implementation costs should be presented in the same line on the income statement as the fees associated with
the hosting element of the arrangements. The Company early adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019, on a
prospective basis. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on its results of operations,
financial position, cash flows or disclosures.
Recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted
ASU 2016-13 - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued
guidance on the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments. The guidance introduces a new

impairment model known as the current expected credit loss model that will replace the incurred loss
impairment methodology currently included under GAAP. This guidance requires entities to present certain
investments in debt securities, trade accounts receivable and other financial assets at their net carrying value
of the amount expected to be collected on the financial statements. The Company early adopted the guidance
on January 1, 2020.
The Company formed an implementation team to review and assess existing financial assets to identify and
evaluate the financial assets subject to the new current expected credit loss model. The Company assessed the
impact of the guidance on its processes and internal controls and has identified and updated existing internal
controls and processes to ensure compliance with the new guidance; such modifications were deemed
insignificant. During the assessment phase, the Company completed checklists to identify the complete
portfolio of assets subject to the current expected credit loss model. The Company determined the guidance
did not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, cash flows or disclosures and
did not record a material cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption.
ASU 2018-13 - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement In August 2018, the
FASB issued guidance on modifying the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements as part of the
disclosure framework project. The guidance modifies, among other things, the disclosures required for Level
3 fair value measurements, including the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs. The
guidance removes, among other things, the disclosure requirement to disclose transfers between Levels 1 and
2. The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Level 3
fair value measurement disclosures should be applied prospectively while all other amendments should be
applied retrospectively. The Company continues to evaluate the effects the adoption of the new guidance will
have on its disclosures.
ASU 2018-14 - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans In August 2018, the
FASB issued guidance on modifying the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit
pension or other postretirement plans as part of the disclosure framework project. The guidance removes
disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial, clarifies the specific requirements of disclosures and
adds disclosure requirements identified as relevant. The guidance adds, among other things, the requirement
to include an explanation for significant gains and losses related to changes in benefit obligations for the
period. The guidance removes, among other things, the disclosure requirement to disclose the amount of net
periodic benefit costs to be amortized over the next fiscal year from accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) and the effects a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates will have
on certain benefit components. The guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, and must
be applied on a retrospective basis with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effects the
adoption of the new guidance will have on its disclosures.
ASU 2019-12 - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued guidance
on simplifying the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions in ASC 740 and providing
simplification amendments. The guidance removes exceptions on intraperiod tax allocations and reporting
and provides simplification on accounting for franchise taxes, tax basis goodwill and tax law changes. The
guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Transition
requirements vary among the exceptions and amendments which include retrospective, modified retrospective

and prospective application. The Company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on its
results of operations, financial position, cash flows and disclosures.
Variable interest entities
The Company evaluates its arrangements and contracts with other entities to determine if they are VIEs and if
so, if the Company is the primary beneficiary. GAAP provides a framework for identifying VIEs and
determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interest and results of
activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.
A VIE should be consolidated if a party with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE
(a variable interest holder) has the power to direct the VIE's most significant activities and the obligation to
absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. A variable interest
holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. Upon consolidation, the primary
beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE's assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair
value and subsequently account for the VIE as if it were consolidated.
The Company's evaluation of whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary of a VIE involves significant
judgments, estimates and assumptions and includes a qualitative analysis of the activities that most
significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and whether the Company has the power to direct those
activities, the design of the entity, the rights of the parties and the purpose of the arrangement.
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of postretirement liability
adjustments.
The postretirement liability adjustment in other comprehensive loss was $7.0 million, net of tax of $2.4
million, for the year ended December 31, 2019.

NOTE 2 – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS
Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or
service to a customer. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer
and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company is
considered an agent for certain taxes collected from customers. As such, the Company presents revenues net
of these taxes at the time of sale to be remitted to governmental authorities, including sales and use taxes.
 As part of the adoption of ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company elected the
practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if
the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is 12 months or less.
Disaggregation
In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by the type of customer or service provided. The Company
believes this level of disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The table also includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated
revenue by business lines.

NOTE 3 – LEASES
Most of the leases the Company enters into are for equipment, buildings and easements as part of their
ongoing operations. The Company also leases certain equipment to third parties. The Company determines if
an arrangement contains a lease at inception of a contract and accounts for all leases in accordance with ASC
842 - Leases. For more information on the adoption of ASC 842, see Note 1.
The recognition of leases requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the lease
classification and the assets and liabilities recorded. The accuracy of lease assets and liabilities reported on
the Consolidated Financial Statements depends on, among other things, management's estimates of interest
rates used to discount the lease assets and liabilities to their present value, as well as the lease terms based on
the unique facts and circumstances of each lease.

                                    Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The leases the Company has entered into as part of its ongoing operations are considered operating leases and
are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as right-of-use assets, current lease liabilities and, if
applicable, noncurrent lease liabilities. The corresponding lease costs are included in operation and
maintenance expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Generally, the leases for equipment have a term of five years or less and buildings and easements have a
longer term of up to 35 years or more. To date, the Company does not have any residual value guarantee
amounts probable of being owed to a lessor, financing leases or material agreements with related parties.
The following tables provide information on the Company's operating leases at and for the year ended
December 31, 2019:

                                   Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
The regulatory assets are expected to be recovered in rates charged to customers. A portion of the Company's
regulatory assets are not earning a return; however, these regulatory assets are expected to be recovered from
customers in future rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $203.5 million and $245.2
million, respectively, of regulatory assets were not earning a rate of return.
During the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company experienced increased natural
gas costs in certain jurisdictions where it supplies natural gas. The Company has recorded these natural gas
costs as regulatory assets as they are expected to be recovered from customers, as discussed in Note 13.
In February 2019, the Company announced that it intends to retire three aging coal-fired electric generating
units in early 2021 and early 2022. The Company has accelerated the depreciation related to these facilities in
property, plant and equipment and has recorded the difference between the accelerated depreciation, in
accordance with GAAP, and the depreciation approved for rate-making purposes as regulatory assets. The
Company expects to recover the regulatory assets related to the plants to be retired in future rates.
If, for any reason, the Company's regulated businesses cease to meet the criteria for application of regulatory
accounting for all or part of their operations, the regulatory assets and liabilities relating to those portions
ceasing to meet such criteria would be removed from the balance sheet and included in the statement of
income or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the discontinuance of
regulatory accounting occurs.
NOTE 6 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures its investments in certain fixed-income and equity securities at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in income. The Company anticipates using these investments, which consist
of an insurance contract, to satisfy its obligations under its unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit plans for
executive officers and certain key management employees, and invests in these fixed-income and equity
securities for the purpose of earning investment returns and capital appreciation. These investments, which
totaled $26.7 million and $22.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are classified as
investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized gains (losses) on these investments for
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, were $4.0 million and ($1.1 million), respectively. The change
in fair value, which is considered part of the cost of the plan, is classified in other income on the Consolidated
Statements of Income.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value ASC
establishes a hierarchy for grouping assets and liabilities, based on the significance of inputs. The estimated
fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are determined using the
market approach. The Company’s Level 2 money market funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held
at the end of the period, based on published market quotations on active markets, or using other known
sources including pricing from outside sources. The estimated fair value of the Company’s Level 2 insurance
contract is based on contractual cash surrender values that are determined primarily by investments in
managed separate accounts of the insurer. These amounts approximate fair value. The managed separate
accounts are valued based on other observable inputs or corroborated market data.

                                        Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Though the Company believes the methods used to estimate fair value are consistent with those used by other
market participants, the use of other methods or assumptions could result in a different estimate of fair value.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.
The Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

The Company applies the provisions of the fair value measurement standard to its nonrecurring, non-financial
measurements, including long-lived asset impairments. These assets are not measured at fair value on an
ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. The Company reviews
the carrying value of its long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
In the second quarter of 2019, the Company reviewed a non-utility investment for impairment. This was a
cost-method investment and was written down to zero using the income approach to determine its fair value,
requiring the Company to record a write-down of $2.0 million, before tax. The fair value of this investment
was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The reduction is reflected in investments on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as within other income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The Company’s long-term debt is not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the fair

Dakota not to permit, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of funded debt to total capitalization
(determined on a consolidated basis) to be greater than 65 percent. Other covenants include limitations on
the sale of certain assets and on the making of certain loans and investments.

The Company prepared a one-time revaluation of the Company's regulatory deferred tax assets and liabilities
in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the enactment of the TCJA. The revaluation was deferred under
regulatory accounting as the Company worked with the various regulators to determine the amount and
timing of amounts to be returned to customers. There were no significant changes between the preliminary
estimate and final determination of taxes refundable to or recoverable from customers.
The changes included in the TCJA were broad and complex. The SEC issued rules that allowed for a
measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the TCJA to finalize the recording of the
related tax impacts. The Company reviewed the impacts of the TCJA and completed its assessment of the
transitional impacts during the period ending December 31, 2018, of which there were no such material
adjustments.
Components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31 were as follows:
                                                                  2019                2018

NOTE 11 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Pension and other postretirement benefit plans
The Company has noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans for certain eligible employees. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for all of its
pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Prior to 2013, all of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans were frozen. These employees were eligible
to receive additional defined contribution plan benefits. In October 2018, the Company transferred the
liability of certain participants in the defined benefit pension plan, who are currently receiving benefits, to an
annuity company. The transfer of the benefit payments for these participants reduced the Company’s liability
and future premiums.
Effective January 1, 2010, eligibility to receive retiree medical benefits was modified. Current employees at
Montana-Dakota and Intermountain, and those hired before June 1, 1992 at Cascade, who had attained age 55
with 10 years of continuous service by December 31, 2010, were provided the option to choose between a
pre-65 comprehensive medical plan coupled with a Medicare supplement or a specified company funded
Retiree Reimbursement Account, regardless of when they retire. All other eligible employees must meet the
new eligibility criteria of age 60 and 10 years of continuous service at the time they retire to be eligible for a
specified company funded Retiree Reimbursement Account. Employees at Montana-Dakota and
Intermountain hired after December 31, 2009, and employees at Cascade hired after June 1, 1992, will not be
eligible for retiree medical benefits.
                                                               123-26

In 2012, the Company modified health care coverage for certain retirees. Effective January 1, 2013, post-65
coverage was replaced by a fixed-dollar subsidy for retirees and spouses to be used to purchase individual
insurance through an exchange.
Changes in benefit obligation and plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and amounts
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the years ended
December 31 were as follows:

The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is based on a targeted asset allocation range determined by
the funded ratio of the plan. As of December 31, 2019, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is
based on the targeted asset allocation range of 40 percent to 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent to 60
percent fixed-income securities and the expected rate of return from these asset categories. The expected rate
of return on other postretirement plan assets is based on the targeted asset allocation of 30 percent equity
securities and 70 percent fixed-income securities and the expected rate of return from these asset categories.
The expected return on plan assets for other postretirement benefits reflects insurance-related investment
costs.
Health care rate assumptions for the Company's other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31 were as
follows:
                                                                         2019                          2018

The Company's other postretirement benefit plans include health care and life insurance benefits for certain
retirees. The plans underlying these benefits may require contributions by the retiree depending on such
retiree's age and years of service at retirement or the date of retirement. The Company contributes a flat dollar
amount to the monthly premiums, which is updated annually on January 1.
Assumed health care cost trend rates may have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
plans. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the
following effects at December 31, 2019:
                                                                     1 Percentage                1 Percentage

In 2019, the Company contributed an additional $12.4 million to its defined benefit pension plans, which
increased the funded status and decreased future expenses for the plans. The Company does not expect to
contribute to its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2020.

Outside investment managers manage the Company's pension and postretirement assets. The Company's
investment policy with respect to pension and other postretirement assets is to make investments solely in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits
accrued and defraying the reasonable expenses of administration. The Company strives to maintain
investment diversification to assist in minimizing the risk of large losses. The Company's policy guidelines
allow for investment of funds in cash equivalents, fixed-income securities and equity securities. The
guidelines prohibit investment in commodities and futures contracts, equity private placement, employer
securities, leveraged or derivative securities, options, direct real estate investments, precious metals, venture
capital and limited partnerships. The guidelines also prohibit short selling and margin transactions. The
Company's practice is to periodically review and rebalance asset categories based on its targeted asset
allocation percentage policy.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value ASC
establishes a hierarchy for grouping assets and liabilities, based on the significance of inputs. The estimated
fair values of the Company's pension plans’ assets are determined using the market approach.
The carrying value of the pension plans’ Level 2 cash equivalents approximates fair value and is determined
using observable inputs in active markets or the net asset value of shares held at year end, which is
determined using other observable inputs including pricing from outside sources.
The estimated fair value of the pension plans’ Level 1 equity securities is based on the closing price reported
on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. The estimated fair value of the pension
plans’ Level 1 and Level 2 collective and mutual funds are based on the net asset value of shares held at year
end, based on either published market quotations on active markets or other known sources including pricing
from outside sources. The estimated fair value of the pension plans’ Level 2 corporate and municipal bonds is
determined using other observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes,
bids, offers, future cash flows and other reference data. The estimated fair value of the pension plans’ Level 1
U.S. Government securities are valued based on quoted prices on an active market.
The estimated fair value of the pension plans’ Level 2 U.S. Government securities are valued mainly using
other observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, to be

Though the Company believes the methods used to estimate fair value are consistent with those used by
other market participants, the use of other methods or assumptions could result in a different estimate of

    percent in other investments.
The estimated fair values of the Company's other postretirement benefit plans’ assets are determined using
the market approach.
The estimated fair value of the other postretirement benefit plans’ Level 2 cash equivalents is valued at the
net asset value of shares held at year end, based on published market quotations on active markets, or using
other known sources including pricing from outside sources. The estimated fair value of the other
postretirement benefit plans’ Level 1 equity securities is based on the closing price reported on the active
market on which the individual securities are traded. The estimated fair value of the other postretirement
benefit plans’ Level 2 insurance contract is based on contractual cash surrender values that are determined
primarily by investments in managed separate accounts of the insurer. These amounts approximate fair value.
The managed separate accounts are valued based on other observable inputs or corroborated market data.
Though the Company believes the methods used to estimate fair value are consistent with those used by
other market participants, the use of other methods or assumptions could result in a different estimate of fair
value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.

Nonqualified benefit plans
In addition to the qualified defined benefit pension plans reflected in the table at the beginning of this note,
the Company also has unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit plans for executive officers and certain key
management employees. Montana-Dakota’s plan provides for defined benefit payments following the
employee’s retirement or, upon death, to their beneficiaries for up to a 15-year period. Cascade’s plan
provides for defined benefit payments following the employee's retirement or, upon death, to their
beneficiaries for up to a 10-year period, plus the surviving spouse is entitled to receive a monthly benefit for
life equal to one-half of the benefit the participant was entitled to before death. Effective October 1, 2003, the
plan was amended so that no new participants will be added to the plan and no additional benefits will accrue
for existing participants. Intermountain’s plan provides for defined benefit payments following the
employee's retirement until death for a minimum of a 20-year period or to their beneficiaries upon pre-
retirement death for a 10-year period equal to twice the benefit the participant was entitled to before death. In
February 2016, the Company froze the unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit plans to new participants and
eliminated benefit increases. Vesting for participants not fully vested was retained.
The projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation for these plans at December 31 were as
follows:
                                              2019         2018

Defined contribution plans
The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans for eligible employees and the costs incurred
under these plans were $12.5 million in 2019 and $11.6 million in 2018.
Multiemployer plans
Intermountain contributes to a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-
bargaining agreement that covers its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in a
multiemployer plan are different from a single-employer plan in the following aspects:
•    Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to
     employees of other participating employers
•    If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be
     borne by the remaining participating employers
•    If the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, the Company may be required to
     pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability
The Company's participation in this plan is outlined in the following table. The most recent Pension
Protection Act zone status available in 2019 and 2018 is for the plan's year-end at December 31, 2018, and
December 31, 2017, respectively. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from
the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less

 NOTE 12 – JOINTLY OWNED FACILITIES
 The consolidated financial statements include Montana-Dakota’s ownership interests in three coal-fired
 electric generating facilities (Big Stone Station, Coyote Station and Wygen III) and one major transmission
 line (BSSE). Each owner of the jointly owned facilities is responsible for financing its investment.
 Montana-Dakota’s share of the jointly owned facilities operating expenses was reflected in the appropriate
 categories of operating expenses (electric fuel and purchased power; operation and maintenance; and taxes,
 other than income) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 At December 31, Montana-Dakota’s share of the cost of utility plant in service, construction work in progress
 and related accumulated depreciation for the jointly owned facilities was as follows:

NOTE 13 – REGULATORY MATTERS
The Company regularly reviews the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each of the jurisdictions
in which service is provided. The Company files for rate adjustments to seek recovery of operating costs and
capital investments, as well as reasonable returns as allowed by regulators. As indicated below, certain
regulatory proceedings and cases may also contain recurring mechanisms that can have an annual true-up.
Examples of these recurring mechanisms include: infrastructure riders, transmission trackers, renewable
resource cost adjustment riders, as well as weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms. The following
paragraphs summarizes the Company's significant regulatory proceedings and cases by jurisdiction including
the status of each open request. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the
timing of final decisions of the various regulators and courts, or the effect on the Company's results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.
MNPUC
On September 27, 2019, Great Plains filed an application with the MNPUC for a natural gas rate increase of
approximately $2.9 million annually or approximately 12.0 percent above current rates. The requested
increase was primarily to recover investments in facilities to enhance safety and reliability and the
depreciation and taxes associated with the increase in investment. On November 22, 2019, Great Plains

11.0 percent, subject to refund, effective January 1, 2020. This matter is pending before the MNPUC.
MTPSC
On November 1, 2019, Montana-Dakota submitted an application with the MTPSC requesting the use of
deferred accounting for the treatment of costs related to the retirement of Lewis & Clark Station in Sidney,
Montana, and units 1 and 2 at the Heskett Station near Mandan, North Dakota. This matter is pending before
the MTPSC.
NDPSC
Montana-Dakota has a transmission cost adjustment rider that allows annual updates to rates for actual costs
for transmission-related projects and services. On July 19, 2019, Montana-Dakota filed a change to its
transmission cost adjustment rates to reflect projected charges for July 2019 through June 2020 assessed to
Montana-Dakota for transmission-related services provided by MISO and Southwest Power Pool, along with
the projected transmission service revenues or credits received for the same time period. Montana-Dakota
also requested recovery of six transmission capital projects. Total revenues of approximately $9.2 million,
which reflects a true-up of the prior period adjustment, were requested resulting in an increase of
approximately $600,000 or approximately 7.2 percent over current rates, which includes approximately
$1.5 million related to transmission capital projects. On October 22, 2019, the NDPSC approved the rates as
requested. The rates were effective October 28, 2019.
Montana-Dakota has a renewable resource cost adjustment rate tariff that allows for annual adjustments for
recent projected capital costs and related expenses for projects determined to be recoverable under the tariff.
On November 1, 2019, Montana-Dakota filed an annual update to its renewable resource cost adjustment
requesting to recover a revenue requirement of approximately $14.7 million annually, not including the prior
period true-up adjustment. The update reflects a decrease of approximately $800,000 from the revenues
currently included in rates. On February 19, 2020, the NDPSC approved the increase with rates effective on
March 1, 2020.
On August 28, 2019, Montana-Dakota filed an application with the NDPSC for an advanced determination of
prudence and a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct, own and operate Heskett Unit 4,

On June 14, 2019, Cascade filed a request with the OPUC to implement a new pipeline safety cost recovery
mechanism to recover investments to replace Cascade's highest risk infrastructure which would have required
Cascade to file a report annually with the OPUC detailing actual projects undertaken and the related costs
incurred. This matter was denied by the OPUC on January 15, 2020.
SDPUC
On November 8, 2019, Montana-Dakota submitted an application with the SDPUC requesting the use of
deferred accounting for the treatment of costs related to the retirement of Lewis & Clark Station in Sidney,
Montana, and units 1 and 2 at Heskett Station near Mandan, North Dakota. The SDPUC approved the use of
deferred accounting treatment as requested on January 7, 2020.
Montana-Dakota has a transmission cost recovery rider that allows annual updates to rates for actual costs for
transmission-related projects and services. On February 28, 2020, Montana-Dakota filed a change to its
transmission cost recovery rates to reflect projected charges for 2020 assessed to Montana-Dakota for
transmission-related services provided by MISO and Southwest Power Pool, along with the projected
transmission service revenues or credits received for the same time period. Montana-Dakota also requested
recovery of two transmission capital projects. Total revenues of approximately $764,000, which reflects a
true-up of the prior period adjustment, were requested resulting in a decrease of approximately $15,000 or
approximately 1.9 percent under current rates, which includes approximately $87,000 related to transmission
capital projects. This matter is pending before the SDPUC.
Montana-Dakota has an infrastructure rider rate tariff that allows for annual adjustments for recent projected
capital costs and related expenses for projects determined to be recoverable under the tariff. On February 28,
2020, Montana-Dakota filed an annual update to its infrastructure rider requesting to recover a revenue
requirement of approximately $1.3 million annually, including the prior period true-up adjustment, an
increase of approximately $300,000 from revenues currently included in rates. This matter is pending before
the SDPUC.
WUTC
On March 29, 2019, Cascade filed a natural gas general rate case with the WUTC requesting an increase in
annual revenue of $12.7 million or approximately 5.5 percent. On September 20, 2019, Cascade filed a joint
settlement agreement with the WUTC reflecting a revised annual increase of approximately $6.5 million or
approximately 2.8 percent with an effective date of March 1, 2020. A settlement hearing was held on
November 5, 2019. On February 3, 2020, the WUTC approved the increase with rates effective on March 1,
2020.
Cascade has a pipeline replacement cost recovery mechanism, which is designed to recover the replacement
cost of the Company's most at risk pipelines. The mechanism requires an annual filing on May 31, as well as
two update filings for actual costs before the November 1 effective date. On May 31, 2019, Cascade filed its
seventh annual update to its pipeline cost recovery mechanism requesting an increase in revenue of
approximately $1.6 million or approximately 0.7 percent. On October 10, 2019, Cascade filed a final update
to the cost recovery mechanism with a revised increase in revenue of approximately $440,000 or
approximately 0.2 percent annually. On October 24, 2019, the WUTC approved the increase with rates
effective for services provided on or after November 1, 2019.

                                    Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
Cascade defers the actual cost of gas spent to serve customers and annually records a true-up to their
purchased gas adjustment tariff. On September 13, 2019, Cascade filed its annual update to its purchased gas
adjustment with the WUTC requesting an annual increase of approximately $12.8 million or approximately
5.7 percent for a period of three years. The requested increase is primarily due to unrecovered purchased gas
costs as a result of the rupture of the Enbridge pipeline in Canada on October 9, 2018, causing increased
natural gas costs. On October 24, 2019, the WUTC approved the increase with rates effective for services
provided on or after November 1, 2019.
WYPSC
On May 23, 2019, Montana-Dakota filed an application with the WYPSC for a natural gas rate increase of
approximately $1.1 million annually or approximately 7.0 percent above current rates. The requested increase
was to recover increased operating expenses and investments in distribution facilities to improve system
safety and reliability. On December 17, 2019, Montana-Dakota filed a settlement agreement with the
WYPSC. On January 15, 2020, the WYPSC approved the settlement, as adjusted to reflect an annual
increase in revenues of approximately $828,000 or approximately 5.5 percent, with rates effective March 1,
2020.
FERC
On December 9, 2019, MISO accepted Montana-Dakota's annual revenue requirement update to its
transmission formula rates under the MISO tariff for its multi-value project for approximately $13.1 million,
which was effective January 1, 2020. The update effective January 1, 2020, reflects the reduced return on
equity order issued by the FERC on November 21, 2019.
NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Claims and Litigation
The Company is party to claims and lawsuits arising out of its business which may include, but are not
limited to, matters involving property damage, personal injury, and environmental, contractual, statutory and
regulatory obligations. The Company accrues a liability for those contingencies when the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated
and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is
accrued. The Company does not accrue liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is
probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only
reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably
possible and which are material, the Company discloses the nature of the contingency and, in some
circumstances, an estimate of the possible loss. Accruals are based on the best information available, but in
certain situations management is unable to estimate an amount or range of a reasonably possible loss
including, but not limited to when: (1) the damages are unsubstantiated or indeterminate, (2) the proceedings
are in the early stages, (3) numerous parties are involved, or (4) the matter involves novel or unsettled legal
theories.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company accrued liabilities, which have not been discounted, of $11.4
million and $13.4 million, respectively. The accruals are for contingencies, including litigation and
environmental matters. This includes amounts that have been accrued for matters discussed in Environmental
matters within this note. The Company will continue to monitor each matter and adjust accruals as might be
                                                      123-41

                                   Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
warranted based on new information and further developments. Management believes that the outcomes with
respect to probable and reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued, net of insurance
recoveries, while uncertain, either cannot be estimated or will not have a material effect upon the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal costs are
expensed as they are incurred.
Environmental matters
Manufactured Gas Plant Sites
 Claims have been made against Cascade for cleanup of environmental contamination at manufactured gas
plant sites operated by Cascade's predecessors and a similar claim has been made against Montana-Dakota for
a site operated by Montana-Dakota and its predecessors. Any accruals related to these claims are reflected in
regulatory assets. For more information, see Note 5.
Demand has been made of Montana-Dakota to participate in investigation and remediation of environmental
contamination at a site in Missoula, Montana. The site operated as a former manufactured gas plant from
approximately 1907 to 1938 when it was converted to a butane-air plant that operated until 1956. Montana-
Dakota or its predecessors owned or controlled the site for a period of the time it operated as a manufactured
gas plant and Montana-Dakota operated the butane-air plant from 1940 to 1951, at which time it sold the
plant. There are no documented wastes or by-products resulting from the mixing or distribution of butane-air
gas. Preliminary assessment of a portion of the site provided a recommended remedial alternative for that
portion of approximately $560,000. However, the recommended remediation would not address any potential
contamination to adjacent parcels that may be impacted by contamination from the manufactured gas plant.
Montana-Dakota and another party agreed to voluntarily investigate and remediate the site and that Montana-
Dakota will pay two-thirds of the costs for further investigation and remediation of the site. Montana-Dakota
received notice from a prior insurance carrier that it will participate in payment of defense costs incurred in
relation to the claim. Montana-Dakota has accrued $375,000 for the remediation of this site.
A claim was made against Cascade for contamination at the Bremerton Gasworks Superfund Site in
Bremerton, Washington, which was received in 1997. A preliminary investigation has found soil and
groundwater at the site contain contaminants requiring further investigation and cleanup. The EPA conducted
a Targeted Brownfields Assessment of the site and released a report summarizing the results of that
assessment in August 2009. The assessment confirms that contaminants have affected soil and groundwater at
the site, as well as sediments in the adjacent Port Washington Narrows. Alternative remediation options have
been identified with preliminary cost estimates ranging from $340,000 to $6.4 million. Data developed
through the assessment and previous investigations indicates the contamination likely derived from multiple
different sources and multiple current and former owners of properties and businesses in the vicinity of the
site may be responsible for the contamination. In April 2010, the Washington DOE issued notice it
considered Cascade a PRP for hazardous substances at the site. In May 2012, the EPA added the site to the
National Priorities List of Superfund sites. Cascade has entered into an administrative settlement agreement
and consent order with the EPA regarding the scope and schedule for a remedial investigation and feasibility
study for the site. Current estimates for the cost to complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study
are approximately $7.6 million of which $4.4 million has been incurred. Cascade has accrued $3.2 million for
the remedial investigation and feasibility study, as well as $6.4 million for remediation of this site; however,
the accrual for remediation costs will be reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, after completion of the remedial
investigation and feasibility study. In April 2010, Cascade filed a petition with the WUTC for authority to
                                                       123-42

                                    Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018
defer the costs incurred in relation to the environmental remediation of this site. The WUTC approved the
petition in September 2010, subject to conditions set forth in the order.
A claim was made against Cascade for contamination at a site in Bellingham, Washington. Cascade received
notice from a party in May 2008 that Cascade may be a PRP, along with other parties, for contamination from
a manufactured gas plant owned by Cascade and its predecessor from about 1946 to 1962. Other PRPs
reached an agreed order and work plan with the Washington DOE for completion of a remedial investigation
and feasibility study for the site. A feasibility study prepared for one of the PRPs in March 2018 identifies
five cleanup action alternatives for the site with estimated costs ranging from $8.0 million to $20.4 million
with a selected preferred alternative having an estimated total cost of $9.3 million. The other PRPs will
develop a cleanup action plan and, after public review of the cleanup action plan, develop design documents.
Cascade believes its proportional share of any liability will be relatively small in comparison to other PRPs.
The plant manufactured gas from coal between approximately 1890 and 1946. In 1946, shortly after
Cascade's predecessor acquired the plant, the plant converted to a propane-air gas facility. There are no
documented wastes or by-products resulting from the mixing or distribution of propane-air gas. Cascade has
recorded an accrual for this site for an amount that is not material.
Cascade has received notices from and entered into agreement with certain of its insurance carriers that they
will participate in defense of Cascade for certain of the contamination claims subject to full and complete
reservations of rights and defenses to insurance coverage. To the extent these claims are not covered by
insurance, Cascade intends to seek recovery of remediation costs through the OPUC and WUTC in its natural
gas rates charged to customers.
Purchase commitments
The Company has entered into various commitments, largely consisting of contracts for natural gas and coal
supply, purchased power, and natural gas transportation and storage contracts. Certain of these contracts are
subject to variability in volume and price. The commitment terms vary in length, up to 41 years.
The commitments under these contracts as of December 31, 2019, were:
                                    2020           2021        2022           2023      2024       Thereafter
                                                                   (In thousands)
  Purchase commitments           $353,485       $222,156     $156,517        $121,954   $86,168     $671,245
These commitments were not reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Amounts
purchased under various commitments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, were $504.1 million
and $450.1 million, respectively.
Guarantees
Cascade has an outstanding letter of credit to a third party related to a remedial investigation feasibility study,
and Intermountain has an outstanding letter of credit to a third party related to gas storage costs. At
December 31, 2019, the fixed maximum amount guaranteed under these letters of credit aggregated $3.6
million, which are scheduled to expire in 2020. There were no amounts outstanding under this letter of credit
at December 31, 2019. In the event of default under these letter of credit obligations, the subsidiary

guaranteeing the letter of credit would be obligated for reimbursement of payments made under the letter of
credit.
Variable interest entities
The Company evaluates its arrangements and contracts with other entities to determine if they are VIEs and if
so, if the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Fuel Contract
Coyote Station entered into a coal supply agreement with Coyote Creek that provides for the purchase of coal
necessary to supply the coal requirements of the Coyote Station for the period May 2016 through December
2040. Coal purchased under the coal supply agreement is reflected in inventories on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and is recovered from customers as a component of electric fuel and purchased power.
The coal supply agreement creates a variable interest in Coyote Creek due to the transfer of all operating and
economic risk to the Coyote Station owners, as the agreement is structured so that the price of the coal will
cover all costs of operations, as well as future reclamation costs. The Coyote Station owners are also
providing a guarantee of the value of the assets of Coyote Creek as they would be required to buy the assets at
book value should they terminate the contract prior to the end of the contract term and are providing a
guarantee of the value of the equity of Coyote Creek in that they are required to buy the entity at the end of
the contract term at equity value. Although the Company has determined that Coyote Creek is a VIE, the
Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of Coyote Creek because the authority to direct
the activities of the entity is shared by the four unrelated owners of the Coyote Station, with no primary
beneficiary existing. As a result, Coyote Creek is not required to be consolidated in the Company's financial
statements.
At December 31, 2019, the Company's exposure to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with the
VIE, based on the Company's ownership percentage was $36.0 million.
NOTE 15 – RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
MDU provides and receives certain support services to/from the Company. The amount charged for services
provided to the Company was $79.2 million and $62.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2018, respectively and the amount charged for services received from the Company was $2.0 million and
$5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The amounts included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to MDU at December 31 were as follows:

put in place by governmental leaders to help limit the spread may have a significant impact on economic
activity in the near term. The Company is monitoring the related impacts; however, it will take time before
the Company can fully determine the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s results of operations, financial
position and cash flows.

                                              Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Gas Utility Plant (Account 108)
  1. Explain in a footnote any important adjustments during year.
  2. Explain in a footnote any difference between the amount for book cost of plant retired, line 10, column (c), and that reported for gas
plant in service, page 204-209, column (d), excluding retirements of nondepreciable property.
  3. The provisions of Account 108 in the Uniform System of Accounts require that retirements of depreciable plant be recorded when
such plant is removed from service. If the respondent has a significant amount of plant retired at year end which has not been recorded
and/or classified to the various reserve functional classifications, make preliminary closing entries to tentatively functionalize the book
cost of the plant retired. In addition, include all costs included in retirement work in progress at year end in the appropriate functional
classifications.
  4. Show separately interest credits under a sinking fund or similar method of depreciation accounting.
  5. At lines 7 and 14, add rows as necessary to report all data. Additional rows should be numbered in sequence, e.g., 7.01, 7.02, etc.

                                  Reconciliation of Reported Net Income with Taxable Income for Feder Income Taxes
  1. Report the reconciliation of reported net income for the year with taxable income used in computing Federal Income Tax accruals
and show computation of such tax accruals. Include in the reconciliation, as far as practicable, the same detail as furnished on Schedule
M-1 of the tax return for the year. Submit a reconciliation even though there is no taxable income for the year. Indicate clearly the
nature of each reconciling amount.
  2. If the utility is a member of a group that files consolidated Federal tax return, reconcile reported net income with taxable net income
as if a separate return were to be filed, indicating, however, intercompany amounts to be eliminated in such a consolidated return. State
names of group members, tax assigned to each group member, and basis of allocation, assignments, or sharing of the consolidated tax
among the group members.
